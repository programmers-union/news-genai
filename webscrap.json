Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 rose 0.8% to 8,694.89. U.S. shares were set to drift higher with Dow futures edging up 0.1% to 45,059.00. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% to 6,093.75.\nIn Asia, Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.6% to finish at 39,066.53. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 surged 1.2% to 8,520.70. South Korea\u2019s Kospi edged up 1.1% to 2,536.75. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.4% to 20,891.62, while the Shanghai Composite added 1.3% to 3,270.66.\nIn Japan, shares of Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. both rose after Japanese media said they were ditching their talks to set up a joint holding company. Neither company confirmed the report. An update on the talks is expected by mid-February, but no date has been set.\nChinese stocks have performed well lately following news on Chinese tech startup DeepSeek, which seems to have caught up with American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost.\nRELATED COVERAGE\n[![Image 14: Trader Daniel Kryger works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025.

After rocking financial markets around the world at the start of this week, worries about a potentially punishing global trade war have eased a bit after Trump gave 30-day reprieves for tariffs on both Mexico and Canada. That bolstered traders\u2019 hopes that Trump sees tariffs as merely a tool for negotiation, rather than as a long-term policy.\n\u201cTraders are closely watching for potential talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Trump. Although no call has taken place yet, markets may find some relief in the absence of new trade hostilities,\u201d said Anderson Alves at ActivTrades.\nIn the meantime, Trump has pressed ahead with tariffs on Chinese goods, and Mericle expects tariffs to hit autos from the European Union, among other potential moves. That could drive a one-time boost to inflation, which could leave a widely followed measure of underlying inflation trends at 2.6% in December, above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%.\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S crude added 17 cents to $71.20 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 10 cents to $74.71 a barrel.\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to 152.58 Japanese yen from 152.55 yen. The euro cost $1.0369, down from $1.0407.\n___\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\nYURI KAGEYAMA\nKageyama covers Japan news for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\nBy Yuri Kageyama\u2009|\u2009AP\nTOKYO \u2014 Asian shares were mostly lower Wednesday as markets mulled the impact of tariffs being imposed by the United States and China.\nJapan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% in early trading to 38,727.19. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5% to 8,417.10. The Hang Seng dropped 0.6% to 20,659.41, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.3% to 3,239.74. South Korea\u2019s Kospi jumped 1.1% to 2,508.58, as investors found bargains after the recent price dips and found optimism from the overnight Wall Street rally.\nSome analysts see tariffs on China as separate from Trump\u2019s moves against other trading partners. Trump may be more likely to keep tariffs on China longer, as he did in his first presidential term, to separate the United States more from its geopolitical rival.\nTrump is pressing ahead with a 10% tariff on U.S. companies importing things from China. And China retaliated on Tuesday by announcing its own tariffs on some U.S. products and an antitrust investigation into Google .\nAdvertisement\nChina\u2019s 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas products, as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the United States won\u2019t take effect until Monday. That leaves time for negotiations between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\u201cTrade tensions haven\u2019t exploded yet, but they\u2019re simmering dangerously close to a full boil, and anyone brushing them off does so at their own risk,\u201d said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.\nOn Wall Street, calm returned, as tech stocks led U.S. indexes higher following a strong profit report from Palantir Technologies, a darling benefiting from the artificial-intelligence boom.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.7% a day after swinging sharply on worries that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could spark a trade war that would hurt economies around the world, including the United States .\nAdvertisement\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 134 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.4%.\nTrump on Monday agreed to delay his taxes on U.S. imports of Canadian and Mexican products for a month. That bolstered Wall Street\u2019s longstanding hopes that Trump\u2019s tough talk on tariffs may be just that, talk. The hope is that Trump sees tariffs as a stick he can use in negotiations with trading partners rather than as a long-term policy.\nThat hope is built in part on traders\u2019 belief that Trump would likely be turned off by the damage Wall Street would take if a worst-case, long-term trade war were to occur. Trump has pointed in the past to the stock market as a real-time measure of his performance.\nBut a trade war is still possible, and some analysts say more swings may be coming because Trump\u2019s threats should be taken both seriously and literally.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cInvestors have suggested the equity market is the US administration\u2019s scorecard and any policy changes that hurt risk assets will be quickly dialed back,\u201d Bank of America strategists led by Mark Cabana wrote in a BofA Global Research report. \u201cWe advise caution.\u201d\nThe stock price of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, rose 2.5% even with China\u2019s antitrust investigation.\nPharmaceutical giant Merck tumbled 9.1% despite beating sales and profit forecasts for the latest quarter. It gave a forecast for upcoming revenue that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations, due partly to a pause in shipments of one of its top-selling products to China .\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 43.31 points to 6,037.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 134.13 to 44,556.04, and the Nasdaq composite gained 262.06 to 19,654.02.\nAdvertisement\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields eased after a report indicated the U.S. job market may be adding less upward pressure on inflation. U.S. employers advertised fewer job openings at the end of December than economists expected, suggesting a slowing but still healthy job market.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.51% from 4.56% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with short-term interest rates, eased to 4.21% from 4.25%\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 20 cents to $72.50 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 31 cents to $75.89 a barrel.\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped to 153.41 Japanese yen from 154.30 yen. The euro cost $1.0386, inching up from $1.0382.\nComments\nSign up\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2025 The Washington Post\nwashingtonpost.com\n\u00a9 1996-2025 The Washington Post", "title": "Stock market today: Asia shares trade mostly lower as as investors weigh impact of US-China tariffs - The Washington Post", "score": 0.3644614, "published_date": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 05:27:12 GMT", "content": "Stock market today: Asia shares trade mostly lower as as investors weigh impact of US-China tariffs - The Washington Post Stock market today: Asia shares trade mostly lower as as investors weigh impact of US-China tariffs Asian shares are trading mostly lower as markets mull the impact of tariffs being imposed by the United States and China Some analysts see tariffs on China as separate from Trump\u2019s moves against other trading partners.

The latest from Trump is his announcement of 25% tariffs on all foreign steel and aluminum coming into the U.S.\nSouth Korea, and to a lesser extent Japan, export steel to the U.S., but the impact on their economies might not be that big since both nations export more in other goods to the U.S.\nLast month, Trump decided to impose 10% duties on all Chinese imports.\nJapan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.2% in afternoon trading to 38,864.96. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.4% to 8,519.40. South Korea\u2019s Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,546.41.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng jumped 1.6% to 21,626.80, as excitement over DeepSeek continued, although market watchers are wondering when the rally might peak. The Shanghai Composite slipped less than 0.1% to 3,317.83.\nThe moves on Wall Street were modest not only for U.S. stocks but also in the bond market, where Treasury yields rose by only a bit.\nThe threat of a possible trade war is real, with high potential stakes. Most of Wall Street agrees that substantial and sustained tariffs would push up prices for U.S. households and ultimately lead to big pain for financial markets around the world.\nRELATED COVERAGE\n[![Image 12: Trader Jonathan Mueller works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025.

That\u2019s what he did earlier with 25% tariffs he had announced for all imports from Canada and Mexico, suggesting tariffs may be merely a negotiating chip rather than a true long-term policy. That in turn has much of Wall Street hoping the worst-case scenario may not happen.\n\u201cThe metal tariffs may serve as negotiating leverage,\u201d according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said again in testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the Fed is in no hurry to ease interest rates any further.\nThe Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply through the end of last year, hoping to give a boost to the economy. But worries about inflation potentially staying stubbornly high have forced the Fed and traders alike to cut back expectations for cuts in 2025. Some traders are even betting on the possibility of no rate cuts, in part because of worries about the effects of tariffs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pretty good place,\u201d Powell said about where the economy and interest rates are currently. He said again he\u2019s aware that going too slowly on rate cuts could damage the economy, while moving too quickly could push inflation higher.\nHigher rates tend to put downward pressure on prices for stocks and other investments, while pressuring the economy by making borrowing more expensive. That could be risky for a U.S. stock market that critics say already looks too expensive. The S&P 500 is not far from its all-time high set late last month.\nOne way companies can offset such downward pressure on their stock prices is to deliver stronger profits. And big U.S. companies have been mostly doing just that recently, as they report how much profit they made during the last three months of 2024. That, though, hasn\u2019t always been enough.\nCoca-Cola rallied 4.7% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. Growth in China, Brazil and the United States helped lead the way. DuPont climbed 6.8% after the chemical company likewise reported better profit than Wall Street expected.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 2.06 points, or less than 0.1%, to 6,068.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.24, or 0.3%, to 44,593.65, and the Nasdaq composite fell 70.41, or 0.4%, to 19,643.86.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.53% from 4.50% late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for upcoming action by the Fed, held steady. It remained at 4.28%, where it was late Monday.\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude fell 29 cents to $73.03 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 27 cents to $76.73 a barrel.\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 153.64 Japanese yen from 152.43 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.0363.\n___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\nYURI KAGEYAMA\nKageyama covers Japan news for The Associated Press.

The Japanese government reported a record current account surplus last year of 29 trillion yen ($191 billion), underlining strong returns on overseas investments, boosted by a weak yen and recovering Japanese exports.\nThe current account data, seen as a wide indicator for trade, grew nearly 30% from the previous year, to its highest since comparable records started being kept in 1985.\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 152.11 Japanese yen from 151.39 yen. The euro cost $1.0304, down from $1.0328.\nThe Hang Seng index jumped 1.5% to 21,442.19, and the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,314.04, despite Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports.\nTechnology shares were among the gainers, as hopes grew for Chinese stimulus measures.

Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.4% to 8,479.30.\nWall Street ended last week with the S&P 500 falling 0.9%, although it remains near its record high set two weeks ago.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 444 points, or 1%, and a sharp fall for Amazon after its latest profit report dragged the Nasdaq composite to a market-leading loss of 1.4%.\nTreasury yields also climbed in the bond market after a discouraging report on Friday morning suggested sentiment is unexpectedly souring among U.S. consumers. The preliminary report from the University of Michigan said U.S. consumers are expecting inflation in the year ahead to hit 4.3%, the highest such forecast since 2023.\nExpectations are growing that U.S. tariffs on a wide range of imported products that Trump has proposed could ultimately push up prices for U.S. consumers.\nMarkets are also watching for the latest earnings reports from U.S. and global companies.\nIn Japan, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. both report earnings on Thursday, as speculation grows their ongoing talks to set up a joint holding company may unravel. Japanese media reports, all citing unidentified sources, sent both stocks gyrating over the past week.\nAmazon, one of Wall Street\u2019s most influential companies, topped analysts\u2019 expectations for earnings at the end of 2024, but its stock nevertheless fell 4.1%. Investors focused instead on its forecast for upcoming revenue, which fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 57.58 points to 6,025.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 444.23 to 44,303.40, and the Nasdaq composite sank 268.59 to 19,523.40.\nIn the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.48% last Friday from 4.44% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, rose more. It climbed to 4.28% from 4.22%.\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 44 cents to $71.44 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 48 cents to $75.14 a barrel.\n___\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\nYURI KAGEYAMA\nKageyama covers Japan news for The Associated Press.

To address this issue, researchers at the University Medical Center Groningen have made strides by successfully establishing and characterizing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of OCCC. These PDX models present what could be a pivotal tool for testing new treatment strategies.\nThe study involved establishing five distinct subcutaneous PDXs from OCCC tumor specimens collected from surgical patients. The researchers found the engraftment success rate of more than 30 percent, providing valuable insights from models closely reflecting the original tumors.\nThe importance of this research lies not only in the establishment of these models but also their genomic relevance. Key mutations commonly associated with OCCC, including alterations found in ARID1A and PIK3CA genes, were identified and retained through the different generations of PDX. These similarities between PDXs and patient tumors suggest the models can serve as reliable representations of human disease.\nDuring the study, various methodologies were employed, including complex genomic and epigenomic analyses. Researchers utilized arrays for copy number and DNA methylation profiling, leading to the discovery of pertinent genomic alterations alongside the histopathological assessments conducted via immunohistochemistry. The models demonstrated significant retention of the tumors' histological characteristics as well.\nFindings indicated minimal changes were observed between the PDX models and the original patient tumors concerning DNA methylation signatures. This suggests the stability of genetic characteristics during the model's establishment, including the maintenance of key oncogenic pathways, which is encouraging for potential therapeutic applications.\nWith the confirmatory analysis showing high fidelity to patient tumor samples, the PDXs established from OCCC patients create new avenues for testing therapies targeting specific mutations. The research offers hope for the development of successful treatments, as well as insights on why many patients with OCCC experience unfavorable outcomes.\nOverall, the developed PDX models code represent not only the anatomical and molecular features of OCCC effectively but also present potent experimental platforms for evaluating novel therapeutic strategies. Future work will focus on applying these models to test promising new drugs or combinations of treatments, attempting to overcome the chemoresistance barrier of OCCC.\nLoved What You Read?

This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Lizzy Boden in London. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Asian stocks and the euro gain after President Trump and Putin agree Talks to end the war in Ukraine. Sources tell us European officials were not warned about the phone call. Jay Powell warned congress there's still more work to do to bring down US inflation. After Consumer Corp consumer prices saw the biggest monthly increase since March. We'll get jobs and PPI data later today. Plus, Japanese media report Honda and Nissan are to scrap tie up talks as both carmakers report results. We'll bring you earnings from Europe, including Siemens, Commerzbank and Nestl\u00e9. Well, a very good morning. Welcome to the program. And we kick off with breaking earnings from Siemens Engineering Energy, first quarter industrial business profit coming in at \u20ac2.52 billion. The estimate was a \u20ac2.43 billion. So a beat there. And we can go straight to an interview with the CEO, Roland Busch. He's been speaking to our very own Oliver Crook. We had a very strong promising start into our Q1. Growth was up 3%, driven by Siemens Healthineers by smart infrastructure and Siemens mobility with six, eight and 10% growth. This industry hold are still back. But on the other side, you saw an order intake growth in digital industries by 6%. And also our automation business in order intake was up 6%. So that's very promising that we get more momentum in our automation business in particular going forward. Free cash flow and net income was up 50%. So we had a very strong start. We we keep our guidance for the full fiscal year. So therefore, we are quite happy. To your point. Yes, smart infrastructure, electrification business has still growth. It's not only datacenters, it's the whole sector which is growing. And for automation, we see signs of recovery. You remember we had a high stock which we're building down. We're coming from 14 weeks now we are down to nine, nine and a half. So we are bottoming out here any time soon. Therefore, momentum, momentum is coming. We see increase in the demand from semiconductors, electronics, aerospace, also chemical is picking up, which is a leading indicator. So we are quite positive that this comes, but we have to look for another quarter before really having a clearer sign, but it's moving in the right direction. So that was the Zeeman CEO, Roland Booth, speaking to Oliver Crook earlier. And we can stay in Germany because we have more earnings this time out of Commerzbank just crossing the terminal as well, really needing to pull out all the stops here to fend off UniCredit, its unwelcome takeover bid, of course. So they're announcing a plan to substantially lift profitability over the coming years. They say this year profits are expected to decline, though, to \u20ac2.4 billion because of restructuring costs, which is going to involve cutting about 3900 roles. Now, we reported that earlier in the week. Of course, European banks having to contend with the pressure of ECB rate cuts. But you are looking at the latest earnings from Commerzbank. Net profit of \u20ac2.4 billion for 2025. So we're going to be speaking to the CEO between all up who's going to be joining the opening trade just after 7 a.m. London time. We also have earnings out of Nestl\u00e9 in Switzerland, the world's biggest food maker. Of course, the backdrop, higher coffee and cocoa costs. And Nestl\u00e9 saying that it sees 2025 underlying trading operating margin. Here at least 16%. So they're pricing in for full year, 1.5% growth. That's more than the estimate of 1.33%. They had already secured 300 million francs of savings for the year. And you're looking at organic revenue of 2.2% growth from an estimate of 2.04%. So a beat there. So those are some of the first earnings that we're getting in this hour. But we could check in now on the broader market as it is a very, very busy day for earnings and geopolitics. You've got futures pointing higher on both sides of the Atlantic. As I say, the US and Russia talking and those talks spurring expectations for an end to the war in Ukraine. Asian markets also looking past that hotter than expected US CPI print. Traders really focusing here on the prospect of peace and as well the momentum in China tech. So the MSCI Asia Pacific index up 1.3%. And if we flip the board over to the cross asset picture, you can see the dollar really has been on a roller coaster ride in the past 24 hours, jumping off that CPI print on these backs of higher rates for longer. And Powell saying that the Fed needs to do more to tame inflation. But then the dollar paring gains yesterday afternoon. And you can see euro dollar now a 1 to 4 handle again boosted by the prospect of peace cable at 124 ahead of this U.K. GDP print. At the top of the hour, ten year Treasury yields at 4.6% and Brent at $74 a barrel. So down partly because of the Trump-Putin talks, they could possibly ease some of these supply concerns. So we really are not short of catalysts this morning. We can dive into one of them. Now, President Trump saying that he's agreed in a phone call with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, to start negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. It reverses three years of US policy on the conflict, with European officials getting no advance warning of this call. Trump says meetings with the Russian president are now being planned. But I'll be dealing with President Putin largely on the phone and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. And we're going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time we'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. Let's get more now from henry Michael Bloomberg, senior russia. Reporter Good morning, henry. Just give us more of a readout of this call between the two leaders because a bit of a divergence between what they say was said. Right. I mean, this is obviously a key moment in Trump's efforts to try and end the war in Ukraine. This is one of his main campaign promises that he made in advance of his election. And we know that there has been contact between Putin and Trump prior to this call. But this is obviously going to be the start of the negotiations, the official start of negotiations. Trump and Putin avoided senior officials to start conducting those talks. And one of them on the American side is Steve Weiskopf. This is a close ally of Trump who, as we know, flew to Russia on Tuesday to secure the freedom of of a US citizen who was held in Russia. And, you know, that is an important inclusion. I think this is someone who has shown in the Middle East that's his main brief is to be the Trump Middle East envoy. But over Russia. Now, he's also going to be involved in trying to end the war. And I think the next step we'll see is, as President Trump mentioned, they are trying to put a meeting together in Saudi Arabia, which would be, you know, a summit between us and Russia. Of course, they have a lot of groundwork to cover before then to try and reach some kind of an agreement before that happens. And it seems pretty fundamental that Trump called Putin before Zelensky. You mentioned the next steps. How fast is this going to move, Henry? Well, I mean, the Trump administration has set a very ambitious goal of finding an agreement within 100 days of the of the US administration, this new US administration personally, that that is very ambitious. But, you know, he he clearly is in a in a hurry Trump. He's threatening to impose sanctions on Russia if Putin doesn't come to a deal soon. But there are some very, very thorny issues. I would say the hardest one is the security guarantees that are going to have to be offered to Ukraine if it's going to sign up to a deal which we expect will involve surrendering control of territory, territory that Russia currently holds. This is a difficult decision for Ukraine, and it's going to want to have some fairly strong guarantees that if Russia attacks again, that it will be protected. Okay. Henry Meyer with the latest on those talks, Bloomberg senior Rush reporter, we thank you. Now, meanwhile, in Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott best presented an economic partnership agreement to President Zelensky during his visit to Kiev. Now the agreement is seen as a way to ensure continued US support. But let's get more now from Bloomberg's Christi Gupta Kristie. Just break this down for us. We've had Treasury Secretary Scott Baston presenting this agreement, but what's actually in it? What's been the Ukrainian response? Well, I think I'll start with the context here, because this is really coming in the backdrop of years of aid and military aid coming from the US administration under Joe Biden to the Ukrainian people in that war effort against Russia. This is also inclusive of loan forgiveness that Joe Biden had really tried to push through in his last days in office as well. These are all things that the Trump administration is very much against. And this is where the economic partnership is very crucial here, because not only do they want to end the war to really stop that extra aid and the extra funding is going from U.S. taxpayers to Ukraine, they also want to get in on some of the critical minerals. Remember, Trump is better known as being a very transactional leader here. He's really talking about where can he get these resources to really build that manufacturing kind of growth in the United States that he's seeking? Ukraine actually does offer value there, especially when it comes to likes of critical minerals. And that's the kind of economic partnership that Scott Bessant is eyeing, especially when he makes his move in Kiev today as well. Other pieces of that include kind of some sort of investment scheme. We don't know the details of that just yet, but that reconstruction narrative is certainly one that's showing up in exchange for really trade. Yeah. And talking of trade, the E.U. trade chief, Maurice Seferovic, talking to Trump's team about finding some sort of solution when it comes to tariffs. Yeah, it's a really interesting one because we know that the EU has kind of been bracing for what comes next from Donald Trump specifically. The issue that you start to see here is what can they offer in return? Now, LNG was a big piece of that. Natural gas was a big piece of that. Okay, well, hold off on the steel. Tariffs will buy more natural gas, but they're knocking on a door that has swung wide open here because not only does Europe need those commodities, but the US is willing to export them. So those next levers are really crucial. Tech regulation has played a key piece in this as well. How can regulation or less regulation in Europe offset perhaps some of the kind of carrot versus stick approach that's coming out of the United States? Those conversations are ramping up, especially as some of that NATO's defense funding is starting to get pulled out of the states as well. So these are all the kind of things that we've been talking about in terms of the European response to the US. Okay, Kristie, to Bloomberg's opening trade anchor. We thank you, Chris. Back with you in just under an hour's time with more on all of these stories. But I just want to check in on the currency reaction to these Trump-Putin talks, because it is moving the euro and the one both initially really jumping on the call on the prospects of peace. China offering to play peacemaker, role role, according to a Wall Street Journal report. But really, in the case of this one, remember, this is exactly the sort of knee jerk reaction that could unravel quickly given the fundamentals, don't necessarily support a stronger renminbi, especially after that US CPI print puts the chance of more than one Fed cut this year in doubt, a point well made on the AM live blog. But we keep across the currency moves coming up, just coming in on the terminal as well. We have the news that Alibaba shares have extended their gains to 9.1% over in Hong Kong, the highest since 2022. And they surge, of course, boosted by this frenzy over Chinese AI, really turning Alibaba into an investor favorite again and injecting new life into the e-commerce giant when really it sunk into obscurity after that years long regulatory crackdown. So an exciting moment moment for Alibaba over in Hong Kong now up 8.8%. So we keep an eye on those shares. But let's update you on what else we have coming up in this busy day. Ahead at the top of the hour, we're going to get new GDP numbers from the Office for National Statistics, a 0.1% drop expected. So not what Chancellor Rachel Reeves would like, ideally, given that her top mission is economic growth. But then at 1:30 p.m. London time, we'll get more data on the US jobless claims, data expected to hover around historically low levels. 5 p.m. then London time Europe's turn. ECB Speaker Naugle And this really in the context of both the ECB debate on where rates should settle neutral rates and the German election given that he is the Bundesbank president as well. So lots coming up and you can get a roundup of their stories and all you need to know by going to the debate newsletter day. Why be go on the terminal if you are a subscriber. But coming up on the show, traders shifting their bets for a Fed rate cut from September to December. We'll have more on that US CPI report on Fed Chair Jay Powell as Congress hearing coming up next. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Daybreak here. Let's go to us. My career now. Inflation picking up broadly last month, further undercutting chances of multiple Fed cuts this year. Fed Chair Jay Powell says the central bank has made substantial progress toward taming inflation, but there's still more work to do. We're close, but not there on inflation. We've had made great progress toward 2%. Last year, inflation was 2.6%. So great progress, but we're not quite there yet. So we want to keep policy restrictive for now. The research over many, many years in many, many jurisdictions shows that some degree of independence is very important in keeping inflation under control. Hindsight suggests that it would have been good if we had tightened earlier. I don't know how much difference that would have made, since you're no longer be borrowing on the credit of the United States. In other words, so Fannie and Freddie would be privately funded. It could lead to that, but there wouldn't be anyone, any federal agency that that can examine banks above 10 billion. I'm not sure we know what the endgame really is here. So that was Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the inflation status. But let's get more from Bloomberg's Valerie title. What else did you have to say, Val? Lizzie, you said some pretty interesting comments when it comes to the functioning of the Treasury market. He's backing looser bank capital rules in order to aid liquidity in the Treasury market, saying we need to work on the Treasury market structure. Part of that can be reducing the supplemental leverage ratio known as the SLR. That would help banks hold more treasuries on their balance sheet. Well, without being punished. And there are leverage ratios for that. We saw a jump in swap spreads on this. Meaning there is more demand for cash treasuries as banks will be able to hold more of them on their balance sheet. However, a lot of the Treasury market reaction yesterday was due to that hot CPI print. Lizzie, if we take a look at the core CPI month on month figure, a 0.4%, that is the hottest reading we've had in this reading since March last year. The first point four we've gotten since then that is tempted the market to push out expectations for a Fed rate cut all the way until December. So we could have a Fed on hold for much of this year. Now, Bloomberg Economics has noted that this jump in inflation has been due to other things, seasonal factors. For instance, this has been the third January in a row, actually, Lizzie, that we've had a hot CPI print. But again, there was a lot of pain in the Treasury market yesterday. If we flip on it, just take a look. There was a near nine basis point rise in the ten year yield as market expects now the Fed to be on pause until December. Okay. Bloomberg's Valerie title with the choppy session post about CPI print on post comments. But we've got plenty more coming up a spring back. Welcome back to Bloomberg Daybreak here at 6:22 a.m. in London. And it is a busy morning for earnings. Just to recap, we've already had Zingerman's results revenue rising on demand for electrification products, posting higher net profit and backing their outlook. And our very own Oliver Crook has been sitting down with the Zeeman CEO, Roland Booth. And take a listen to what he had to say. We saw this growth also in the last quarter of the last year. This is particular growth driven by smart infrastructure, smart infrastructure as a very, very strong foothold in the United States. Is it in building technology, in the kind of equipment, solutions and services, but also electrification? Remember, we invested also in our capacity in the United States for electrification. So is medium voltage, low voltage products, but also any kind of products which go into data centers, fire safety, security, building automation. So we see a strong pull their software, this business that's in the United States, this is growing. It grew again strongly by 15%. So therefore, we have a strong software business. Remember, we also have our acquisitions. There's an acquisition is Altair invested 10 billion into Altair. This we expect the closing in the second half of the year. So therefore, this is a growth momentum which comes and we are there at the right time with a very strong footprint, 40,000 people. The United States is 25% of our revenue coming from there. So that's should really give us a lot of momentum also in the years to come. And I'd like to also get your reaction to the latest sort of tariff action we've had from Donald Trump. Obviously, he sort of began with aluminum and steel. This could obviously expand to other sort of divisions. What is the sort of impact do you think is going to be on Zingerman's and how is it affecting your strategy and how you're looking at this year? So I think the biggest impact is any kind of trade restrictions. They ultimately result in higher inflation first and foremost before the reshuffling. So for Siemens, we are a global company, but with a very, very local footprint. I talked about the United States. I can say the same for for India, for China. We have 30,000 people there, also local manufacturing in all places. So therefore, we would see an impact. But it's not that strong. It's more about how is it impacting the market in total. And first and foremost, second point comes what happens is that since customers see higher tariffs, they of course, they relocate, they value add it. So we believe that could be tailwind for Siemens, because if you want to build a new plant and Siemens is there and you're going to build it in an environment where we have less and less labor or high, high cost labor, you want to automate and digitalize this plant as much as you can. And if you look for an answer to that from technology perspective, come to Siemens. We are leading in automation, we are leading industrial software, but also in industrial AI, we can provide answers to the questions how to ramp up a smaller lot size manufacturing, fully automated. Very good examples. Also with our partners Industrial Corp, how to design virtual PSC, where we are basically reshaping this the way how you automate. So it's a lot of technology in the pipeline which we can help you. And I'd like to also get your insight on what you're seeing in the Chinese market. Obviously, we've been talking about for years waiting for this recovery in China. Do you see any signs of that now or do you think that this is going to be some more sort of stagnation for this year, 2025? So we do see a signed sign there. We see electronic semiconductors coming up. Chemical industry, which is a leading industry, has shows momentum. There also actually in particular in China, automotive industry in other places. This is not so therefore, and the government is taking actions. They want to bring the confidence of the people back, the trigger some actions in order to really get life again into the construction sector. Again, this boosts also confidence. And I believe the whole story about deep sea is also putting a lot of self-confidence into people's minds. So therefore demand will come back. Government is taking actions. It's not a kick start. I would not say that. But we see that this economy is picking up momentum, in particular in the space where we are, which is the investment space. So that was the theme. And CEO Roland Breuer, speaking to Oliver Crook, shares up 12% year to date. So we'll keep an eye on the stock at the open. Meanwhile, in at 7:00 London time, we're going to get the latest UK GDP numbers. Economists are expecting a 0.1% drop after a stagnant third quarter. But this is crucial because it could put the UK back on the brink of recession. And remember, the Bank of England already last week downgraded its growth forecasts for the U.K.. You can see that here. Our reporters also got their hands on a copy of the Office for Budget Responsibilities first draft of its updated growth outlook, another downgrade there. All of which is bad news for Rachel Reeves, because, of course, she has just announced this raft of measures to boost growth that are not going to materialize for decades. It looks like growth, the government's top priority, part of what economists reckon weighed on growth was her gloomy messaging after the election last year. And most importantly, weak growth, of course, impact her headroom and if she runs out of that, she's going to have to cut spending. Given she's ruled out more tax rises or breaking her fiscal rules. But we've got plenty more coming up on the program. We're going to get back to the geopolitics. Trump setting his sights on stopping the war in Ukraine. I'll get you the details next. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. A very good morning. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Lizzie Borden in London. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Asian stocks and the euro gain after President Trump and Putin agreed talks to end the war in Ukraine. Sources tell us European officials were not warned about the phone call. Jay Powell warns Congress there's still more work to do to bring down US inflation after core consumer prices saw the biggest monthly increase since March. We'll bring you the jobs and PPI data later on today. Plus, Japanese media report Honda, A Nissan R to scrap tie up talks as both carmakers report their results. We'll bring you earnings from Europe, including Nestl\u00e9. Well, a very good morning. Welcome to an extremely busy Thursday, both in terms of earnings and geopolitics, checking in on these markets and we've got futures pointing higher on both sides of the Atlantic on these expectations of an end to the war in Ukraine off the back of the US, Russia talks. Asian markets looking past that hotter than expected US CPI print as traders focus on the prospects of peace but also momentum in China Tech. We'll get into that in just a moment. But flipping over to the cross asset picture, the dollar's really been on a roller coaster ride off the back of the CPI print because of these bets of higher rates for longer. But it pared gains yesterday afternoon and now you've got euro dollar that at 1 to 4, up half of a percent as well because of the prospect of peace. But we've got the pound there at 124. Again, looking ahead to UK GDP at the top of the hour, Treasury yields at 4.6% on the ten year and oil down at $74 a barrel, down 8/10 of a percent because maybe the prospect of peace could ease some of these supply concerns. So no shortage of catalysts this morning. But let's get into the Alibaba moves as well, because you are looking at that individual stock currently higher, 6.9%. Now that's pared its some of its earlier gains. It was up 9.1% in Hong Kong at its highest since 2022. But if we put it into context, it's up from the 57, up 57% from the January trough, but still down 59% from the 2021 peak. So this frenzy over Chinese artificial intelligence turning it into a bit of an investor favourite, again, really putting a bit of life into the e-commerce giant, having pretty much sunk into obscurity after this year's long regulatory crackdown. So a surprise reversal of fortunes for Alibaba, which had kind of fallen out of favour, hadn't it, given Beijing's clampdown on the tech behemoths in that country? We also in Asia have breaking earnings from Honda, Of course, this morning we have had a report that Honda and Nissan's board have approved ending the merger talks. So that somewhat overshadowing these numbers. This morning, we have the news of that earnings expecting this morning. Operating income coming in at \u00a5397.3 billion. The estimate was for \u00a5406.9 billion. So a miss on operating income. We are expecting the CEO to hold a briefing on the integration that has been put off the table for now. Officially, Nissan calling off the talks to combine but continuing talks on strategic partnership so that the latest on Hong Kong of course, it also faces the Trump tariff threat. Both Nissan and Honda have extensive manufacturing operations in Mexico. The shares down 8.5% year to date. But let's get back to the geopolitics now. President Trump saying that he has agreed in a phone call with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, to start negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. It reverses three years of US policy on the conflict, with European officials getting no advance warning of that call. Trump says meetings with the Russian president are now being planned. But I'll be dealing with President Putin largely on the phone and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. And we're going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time we'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's Oliver Crook out of Munich. And Ollie, it seems like an absolutely fundamental moment that Trump has spoken to Putin before. Zelensky But what do we know about what they said on that call? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the president, Donald Trump, is really sort of trying to move very, very fast with a number of things. So there's obviously this call with Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, again breaking with precedent of the last several years of the Ukraine conflict from US policy of European policy, and basically just wanting to get things moving. And we knew this was going to a certain degree be Trump's approach, much more pragmatic approach. But what's interesting is it's going at the same time as Pete Hegseth, the US Defense secretary, is here in Europe. You also had Scott Benson, the Secretary Treasury secretary, over in Ukraine, to discuss with Zelensky potentially economic cooperation going forward. So all of these things happening at once. If if Scott Bessen in there in Ukraine, basically what the Trump administration does is it is leaving the door open to continue to support Ukraine if they need to maybe even wrapping it up if Putin doesn't come to the negotiating table, but they want to get paid back. So where how they're going to get paid back potentially in the sort of mineral deposits with Ukraine and sort of opening up the sort of economic ties from the defense side of things. And this was in Brussels with the US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaking yesterday. We don't yet have the Trump plan in terms of what he wants to see the peace plan in Ukraine look like. But we began to get some of the contours from the defense secretary of the United States. Have a listen to what he had to say yesterday. The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops as part of any security guarantee. There will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. So that you get very sort of clearly from the US Defense secretary, no US troops to sort of be in there as a defense keeping force. He really wants the burden to shift from the United States to the Europeans in the sort of long term security of Ukraine. But again, he kept saying the word realistic. What is realistic? What is not realistic? This is an administration that is moving away from the sort of principles, I think, that were guiding the Biden administration into the pragmatics of just trying to get it done. Yeah, an about face from Biden to Trump policy on Ukraine. But how is it being seen in Europe? Is it seen as a capitulation to Putin? Perhaps. I mean, that's one of the great concerns, right. And I think that what we keep hearing from these sort of Europeans and we've heard from the beginning of the war from the Biden administration is basically no decision about Ukraine without Ukraine. Right. That has been the sort of the conversation throughout. Now, we understand that Trump basically sees this as a negotiation between himself and Vladimir Putin. But the other point is that, you know, no decision about Ukraine without Ukraine, perhaps, but there's increasingly seems like there's going to be decisions about Ukraine without the Europeans. I mean, they're getting all of this information as fast as, you know, sort of we are it seems they're not getting briefed on these calls with Putin. They're not getting sort of in the room. So what will be absolutely crucial here in Munich, which is why we're here, is the Munich Security Conference. This is where we're going to actually have really the first high level meetings between the Europeans and the new Trump administration. We have J.D. Vance here. We have Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. We have Keith Kellogg, the special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The question is going to be how much input are the Europeans going to get in this sort of situation? Are they just going to be told basically what Trump is thinking and they need to acquiesce? And it's sort of very awkward because it's not only that, you know, the United States may be acting unilaterally. They're also going to be expecting a lot from the Europeans in terms of security guarantees, paying for the security of Ukraine and potentially, you know, peacekeeping forces within Ukraine. We're talking about potentially European troops within Ukraine after a cease fire deal in order to preserve the peace there. That is something that is going to be very difficult to sell on a national level. I've spoken to senior lawmakers in Germany about this, and they're sort of very reluctant to commit to anything that looks anything like that. Okay. Bloomberg's Oliver Crop bringing all of the threads together for us from Munich ahead of the Munich Security Conference. We thank you. Now let's get back to the earnings story here in Europe. Michelin saying that difficult conditions for the tire maker on the tire market are going to continue in the coming months because of the downturn for the autos industry. This after Europe's biggest tire manufacturer reported sales volumes down 5.1% in the year 2024. I'm pleased to say that I can speak now to Michelin's CFO Eve SHAPIRO, who joins me from Paris. A very good morning to you, Eve. Just take me through these results that you have reported. Hey, good morning, Lizzie. Thank you for having me. Despite the conditions that you describe very well, uh, Michelin posted very strong, very robust results that showed that our overall revenue went down, that we have been able to stabilize our operating margin at 12.6% at constant exchange rates. And we we record the second largest free cash flow in the group history of \u20ac2.2 billion. So that's given the conditions, the volatility of the market, uh, the inflows of Asian tires in anticipation of regulation change or tariffs. Uh, it's a, it's a it's a remarkable performance. Well, yeah, I know you've got plants in Mexico and Canada. So how are Trump's tariffs affecting you? So for the time being, there is no tariff between the US, Mexico and Canada. Michigan employed 20,000 employees in the US. We have 35 factories of which 20 produce styles and roughly 70% of the tires that we are selling in USA are produced in us. On top of that, we have some factories in the USA producing, for example, mining tires that I exported all over the world. So our US operations are of course integrated with our Canadian and Mexican operations. We just have to factor in in Mexico, in Freon, in Canada. Our largest operations by far in North America are in the US. Yeah. I mean, your CEO's talked about investing more in the US, possibly at the expense of the European size, to counter these tariff threats. Can you, can you give us more detail on that strategy and what you're planning to do there? No. I wish you did not say that. It will be at the expense of the European investments we have. What you said is that it's given the competitive challenge that we are facing in Europe, energy cost, labour cost, or the whole. It's a business taxation and the arraignment process. A lot of norms, uh, it's difficult to export from Europe and in us we have, as I said, we have very large operations. We are constantly investing to renew our tools in North America. And what Flor was saying is that maybe we have to prioritize, uh, some project in the US versus Mexico or Canada, but not at the expense of European operations. But so difficult to export from Europe, but within Europe. What's the demand outlook for EVs looking like? So the market, the EV market last year was stable, was stalling in India, in Europe, in overall passenger car market for original equipment that dropped, uh, by 7% over the year. Uh, and that showed that we have a, we have been experiment in Europe, uh, tough market conditions where at the same time all original equipment, uh, segments were well down. Uh, and particularly at the expense in automotive or other of electric vehicles because mostly because of the cost of electric vehicle first, but as well because consumers sometimes are a bit lost about what, what, what kind of a, uh, power engine they should, uh, they should buy, uh, which triggered these difficulties. On top of that, some countries have move back and forth regarding the incentive for electric vehicles. I've really got to talk to you this morning. Eve shopper, CFO of Michelin. Thank you. Coming up on the program, Wall Street banks are planning to expand their crypto offerings amid Trump's embrace of the industry. We're going to speak to the managing partner from venture capital firm Stillman. So do stay with us for that conversation coming up next. This is Bloomberg. The Stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework that addresses stablecoin risk directly, fully and narrowly. This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Wallace, speaking there on some of Wall Street's biggest banks are planning to ramp up their involvement in the crypto industry. This as banks are betting that the Trump administration is pro crypto policy will lead to a wave of IPO share sales and convertible bonds. While we can talk now about all of this with Elise Khalid, who is managing partner at Bitcoin focused venture capital firm. Still, Mark, really good to have you back, Elise, on DAYBREAK. Europe. You heard those comments from wallet that Stablecoins have the potential, he says, to maintain and expand the international role of the dollar. What do you make of them? I think that's absolutely correct. And the year has started with significant announcements for stablecoin activity in the crypto sphere with TETHER announcing on January 30th that they plan to launch Usdc on Bitcoin and on lightning. That of course is possible via the Taproot Assets Protocol, developed by Smart portfolio company Lightning Labs with contributions from the broader open source developer community. And the protocol itself was made possible by a recent upgrade to Bitcoin protocol. Taproot. And just as we've seen this kind of about face from the Trump administration, from the Biden administration on Ukraine policy, as we were discussing earlier, you're also seeing the Trump administration embracing crypto in a way that you might say the Biden administration did not. We're still, though, at least waiting for more clarity on regulation. What would you like to see? What would be the most beneficial? Regulatory clarity is certainly overdue in the Bitcoin field. And of course the integrity, integrity of regulatory bodies is also important. It's stability that benefits Bitcoin startups, and as startups are correlated with Bitcoin's price and that startups drive adoption expand Bitcoin's utility. Regulatory stability is also important for Bitcoin. And as I said, Bitcoin begins the year with incredible momentum. There are several forces behind that. So the the transition of tether from crypto protocols like Tron saw an end to theory and soon to come to Bitcoin and Bitcoin's Lightning Network is significant for bitcoin because of the incredible activity that Tether and Stablecoins have seen on other protocols in 2020. For 400 million users worldwide use tether to transact over 10 trillion in volume across chains that are frankly less efficient than what's provided by Bitcoin and Bitcoin's Lightning Network. And so for those new users coming to Bitcoin and Bitcoin's Lightning Network to access Stablecoins to transact what they will, what they will benefit in this integration is instant settlement time and much lower transaction fees. So where fees have been ranging recently between $0.04 and over $10, with fees spiking much higher than that based on activity with lightning, what users will find is instant settlement at a fraction of a cent, and that's consistent even as activity scales now for tether the benefits of. I just wanted to say, given, you know, the uncertainty about regulation you are seeing and we're showing it here, a bit of a lackluster run for Bitcoin over the past week or so. We're not the $100,000 mark where we were previously. What do you think could get it past that again? Well, that's exactly right. And I think that reflects the importance of the broader economy for Bitcoin. And so as we've seen instability in the economy, questions around general global stability and the the sort of position of regulatory bodies in, you know, within the United States, that uncertainly uncertainty translates and affects Bitcoin. It translates to Bitcoin. Of course, Bitcoin's price is significantly up over the past 12 months. And so even though we've seen some instability and uncertainty that's affected the economy as a whole and and Bitcoin itself, it's still Bitcoin's performance has been incredibly strong. The the ramifications of regulatory clarity are not just important for Bitcoin's price, but also for the adoption of Bitcoin. One of the areas that we've seen that emerge is an enterprise adoption for Bitcoin and the Treasury. Yeah. At least clean managing partner. It's still not always good to talk to you. We thank you. And we'll get back to that macro picture in just a moment. So do stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Its base reasoning is very good. In fact, the book, even without fine tuning graph three the base model is better than not to so. So we're really in the final stages of publishing group three. Probably it gets released in about a week or two. So pretty soon I think the evidence is there in that arena has gotten this far while having at least a sort of dual profit nonprofit role. What they're trying to do now is completely delete the nonprofit and and that seems really going too far. So that was the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk there discussing Openai in a conversation at the World Government Summit in Dubai invokes G.M. BERSET. She joins us now in Dubai with more. Jomana, what else did Elon Musk have to say? Yeah, well, it was one of the signature panels this year at the World Government Summit on day three, no less. A conversation between Elon Musk, who dealt in virtually to the summit and the UAE air minister that was eminent. And they spoke about a whole bunch of things, including Doge. What Elon Musk plan is with the reduction of the size of some of these US agencies, and he actually said we need to delete entire agencies and many of them. So again, reiterating what he's been saying the last couple of weeks and that the size of the US government needs to be shrunk. But then some comments about open air as well. Now, I didn't ask him directly about the bids that they must consortium put in for open air. But what he did say, what Mutt said, is that Openai has shifted away from its origins. It started as a non-profit, an open source model. It's moved away from that and he would like to see it return to back to what it was, but didn't actually touch on the fact that he put in a bid for it. And of course, our very own Tom Mackenzie spoke to some Altman the other day. They outright rejected any bid from Elon Musk and said that it was coming from a place of insecurity. He didn't actually touch on that on the panel. But very interesting to hear from Elon Musk at the World Government Summit. He also made a big announcement. They're opening up a loop, a loop. It's a buy loop for transport systems over here in the UAE. Yep. Flew past chairman of us actually, with a round up of what Elon Musk had to say in Dubai. The opening trades coming up next with Guy Christine on it, taking you all the way to the open.

This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Lizzy Boden in London. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Asian stocks and the euro gain after President Trump and Putin agree Talks to end the war in Ukraine. Sources tell us European officials were not warned about the phone call. Jay Powell warned congress there's still more work to do to bring down US inflation. After Consumer Corp consumer prices saw the biggest monthly increase since March. We'll get jobs and PPI data later today. Plus, Japanese media report Honda and Nissan are to scrap tie up talks as both carmakers report results. We'll bring you earnings from Europe, including Siemens, Commerzbank and Nestl\u00e9. Well, a very good morning. Welcome to the program. And we kick off with breaking earnings from Siemens Engineering Energy, first quarter industrial business profit coming in at \u20ac2.52 billion. The estimate was a \u20ac2.43 billion. So a beat there. And we can go straight to an interview with the CEO, Roland Busch. He's been speaking to our very own Oliver Crook. We had a very strong promising start into our Q1. Growth was up 3%, driven by Siemens Healthineers by smart infrastructure and Siemens mobility with six, eight and 10% growth. This industry hold are still back. But on the other side, you saw an order intake growth in digital industries by 6%. And also our automation business in order intake was up 6%. So that's very promising that we get more momentum in our automation business in particular going forward. Free cash flow and net income was up 50%. So we had a very strong start. We we keep our guidance for the full fiscal year. So therefore, we are quite happy. To your point. Yes, smart infrastructure, electrification business has still growth. It's not only datacenters, it's the whole sector which is growing. And for automation, we see signs of recovery. You remember we had a high stock which we're building down. We're coming from 14 weeks now we are down to nine, nine and a half. So we are bottoming out here any time soon. Therefore, momentum, momentum is coming. We see increase in the demand from semiconductors, electronics, aerospace, also chemical is picking up, which is a leading indicator. So we are quite positive that this comes, but we have to look for another quarter before really having a clearer sign, but it's moving in the right direction. So that was the Zeeman CEO, Roland Booth, speaking to Oliver Crook earlier. And we can stay in Germany because we have more earnings this time out of Commerzbank just crossing the terminal as well, really needing to pull out all the stops here to fend off UniCredit, its unwelcome takeover bid, of course. So they're announcing a plan to substantially lift profitability over the coming years. They say this year profits are expected to decline, though, to \u20ac2.4 billion because of restructuring costs, which is going to involve cutting about 3900 roles. Now, we reported that earlier in the week. Of course, European banks having to contend with the pressure of ECB rate cuts. But you are looking at the latest earnings from Commerzbank. Net profit of \u20ac2.4 billion for 2025. So we're going to be speaking to the CEO between all up who's going to be joining the opening trade just after 7 a.m. London time. We also have earnings out of Nestl\u00e9 in Switzerland, the world's biggest food maker. Of course, the backdrop, higher coffee and cocoa costs. And Nestl\u00e9 saying that it sees 2025 underlying trading operating margin. Here at least 16%. So they're pricing in for full year, 1.5% growth. That's more than the estimate of 1.33%. They had already secured 300 million francs of savings for the year. And you're looking at organic revenue of 2.2% growth from an estimate of 2.04%. So a beat there. So those are some of the first earnings that we're getting in this hour. But we could check in now on the broader market as it is a very, very busy day for earnings and geopolitics. You've got futures pointing higher on both sides of the Atlantic. As I say, the US and Russia talking and those talks spurring expectations for an end to the war in Ukraine. Asian markets also looking past that hotter than expected US CPI print. Traders really focusing here on the prospect of peace and as well the momentum in China tech. So the MSCI Asia Pacific index up 1.3%. And if we flip the board over to the cross asset picture, you can see the dollar really has been on a roller coaster ride in the past 24 hours, jumping off that CPI print on these backs of higher rates for longer. And Powell saying that the Fed needs to do more to tame inflation. But then the dollar paring gains yesterday afternoon. And you can see euro dollar now a 1 to 4 handle again boosted by the prospect of peace cable at 124 ahead of this U.K. GDP print. At the top of the hour, ten year Treasury yields at 4.6% and Brent at $74 a barrel. So down partly because of the Trump-Putin talks, they could possibly ease some of these supply concerns. So we really are not short of catalysts this morning. We can dive into one of them. Now, President Trump saying that he's agreed in a phone call with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, to start negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. It reverses three years of US policy on the conflict, with European officials getting no advance warning of this call. Trump says meetings with the Russian president are now being planned. But I'll be dealing with President Putin largely on the phone and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. And we're going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time we'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. Let's get more now from henry Michael Bloomberg, senior russia. Reporter Good morning, henry. Just give us more of a readout of this call between the two leaders because a bit of a divergence between what they say was said. Right. I mean, this is obviously a key moment in Trump's efforts to try and end the war in Ukraine. This is one of his main campaign promises that he made in advance of his election. And we know that there has been contact between Putin and Trump prior to this call. But this is obviously going to be the start of the negotiations, the official start of negotiations. Trump and Putin avoided senior officials to start conducting those talks. And one of them on the American side is Steve Weiskopf. This is a close ally of Trump who, as we know, flew to Russia on Tuesday to secure the freedom of of a US citizen who was held in Russia. And, you know, that is an important inclusion. I think this is someone who has shown in the Middle East that's his main brief is to be the Trump Middle East envoy. But over Russia. Now, he's also going to be involved in trying to end the war. And I think the next step we'll see is, as President Trump mentioned, they are trying to put a meeting together in Saudi Arabia, which would be, you know, a summit between us and Russia. Of course, they have a lot of groundwork to cover before then to try and reach some kind of an agreement before that happens. And it seems pretty fundamental that Trump called Putin before Zelensky. You mentioned the next steps. How fast is this going to move, Henry? Well, I mean, the Trump administration has set a very ambitious goal of finding an agreement within 100 days of the of the US administration, this new US administration personally, that that is very ambitious. But, you know, he he clearly is in a in a hurry Trump. He's threatening to impose sanctions on Russia if Putin doesn't come to a deal soon. But there are some very, very thorny issues. I would say the hardest one is the security guarantees that are going to have to be offered to Ukraine if it's going to sign up to a deal which we expect will involve surrendering control of territory, territory that Russia currently holds. This is a difficult decision for Ukraine, and it's going to want to have some fairly strong guarantees that if Russia attacks again, that it will be protected. Okay. Henry Meyer with the latest on those talks, Bloomberg senior Rush reporter, we thank you. Now, meanwhile, in Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott best presented an economic partnership agreement to President Zelensky during his visit to Kiev. Now the agreement is seen as a way to ensure continued US support. But let's get more now from Bloomberg's Christi Gupta Kristie. Just break this down for us. We've had Treasury Secretary Scott Baston presenting this agreement, but what's actually in it? What's been the Ukrainian response? Well, I think I'll start with the context here, because this is really coming in the backdrop of years of aid and military aid coming from the US administration under Joe Biden to the Ukrainian people in that war effort against Russia. This is also inclusive of loan forgiveness that Joe Biden had really tried to push through in his last days in office as well. These are all things that the Trump administration is very much against. And this is where the economic partnership is very crucial here, because not only do they want to end the war to really stop that extra aid and the extra funding is going from U.S. taxpayers to Ukraine, they also want to get in on some of the critical minerals. Remember, Trump is better known as being a very transactional leader here. He's really talking about where can he get these resources to really build that manufacturing kind of growth in the United States that he's seeking? Ukraine actually does offer value there, especially when it comes to likes of critical minerals. And that's the kind of economic partnership that Scott Bessant is eyeing, especially when he makes his move in Kiev today as well. Other pieces of that include kind of some sort of investment scheme. We don't know the details of that just yet, but that reconstruction narrative is certainly one that's showing up in exchange for really trade. Yeah. And talking of trade, the E.U. trade chief, Maurice Seferovic, talking to Trump's team about finding some sort of solution when it comes to tariffs. Yeah, it's a really interesting one because we know that the EU has kind of been bracing for what comes next from Donald Trump specifically. The issue that you start to see here is what can they offer in return? Now, LNG was a big piece of that. Natural gas was a big piece of that. Okay, well, hold off on the steel. Tariffs will buy more natural gas, but they're knocking on a door that has swung wide open here because not only does Europe need those commodities, but the US is willing to export them. So those next levers are really crucial. Tech regulation has played a key piece in this as well. How can regulation or less regulation in Europe offset perhaps some of the kind of carrot versus stick approach that's coming out of the United States? Those conversations are ramping up, especially as some of that NATO's defense funding is starting to get pulled out of the states as well. So these are all the kind of things that we've been talking about in terms of the European response to the US. Okay, Kristie, to Bloomberg's opening trade anchor. We thank you, Chris. Back with you in just under an hour's time with more on all of these stories. But I just want to check in on the currency reaction to these Trump-Putin talks, because it is moving the euro and the one both initially really jumping on the call on the prospects of peace. China offering to play peacemaker, role role, according to a Wall Street Journal report. But really, in the case of this one, remember, this is exactly the sort of knee jerk reaction that could unravel quickly given the fundamentals, don't necessarily support a stronger renminbi, especially after that US CPI print puts the chance of more than one Fed cut this year in doubt, a point well made on the AM live blog. But we keep across the currency moves coming up, just coming in on the terminal as well. We have the news that Alibaba shares have extended their gains to 9.1% over in Hong Kong, the highest since 2022. And they surge, of course, boosted by this frenzy over Chinese AI, really turning Alibaba into an investor favorite again and injecting new life into the e-commerce giant when really it sunk into obscurity after that years long regulatory crackdown. So an exciting moment moment for Alibaba over in Hong Kong now up 8.8%. So we keep an eye on those shares. But let's update you on what else we have coming up in this busy day. Ahead at the top of the hour, we're going to get new GDP numbers from the Office for National Statistics, a 0.1% drop expected. So not what Chancellor Rachel Reeves would like, ideally, given that her top mission is economic growth. But then at 1:30 p.m. London time, we'll get more data on the US jobless claims, data expected to hover around historically low levels. 5 p.m. then London time Europe's turn. ECB Speaker Naugle And this really in the context of both the ECB debate on where rates should settle neutral rates and the German election given that he is the Bundesbank president as well. So lots coming up and you can get a roundup of their stories and all you need to know by going to the debate newsletter day. Why be go on the terminal if you are a subscriber. But coming up on the show, traders shifting their bets for a Fed rate cut from September to December. We'll have more on that US CPI report on Fed Chair Jay Powell as Congress hearing coming up next. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Daybreak here. Let's go to us. My career now. Inflation picking up broadly last month, further undercutting chances of multiple Fed cuts this year. Fed Chair Jay Powell says the central bank has made substantial progress toward taming inflation, but there's still more work to do. We're close, but not there on inflation. We've had made great progress toward 2%. Last year, inflation was 2.6%. So great progress, but we're not quite there yet. So we want to keep policy restrictive for now. The research over many, many years in many, many jurisdictions shows that some degree of independence is very important in keeping inflation under control. Hindsight suggests that it would have been good if we had tightened earlier. I don't know how much difference that would have made, since you're no longer be borrowing on the credit of the United States. In other words, so Fannie and Freddie would be privately funded. It could lead to that, but there wouldn't be anyone, any federal agency that that can examine banks above 10 billion. I'm not sure we know what the endgame really is here. So that was Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the inflation status. But let's get more from Bloomberg's Valerie title. What else did you have to say, Val? Lizzie, you said some pretty interesting comments when it comes to the functioning of the Treasury market. He's backing looser bank capital rules in order to aid liquidity in the Treasury market, saying we need to work on the Treasury market structure. Part of that can be reducing the supplemental leverage ratio known as the SLR. That would help banks hold more treasuries on their balance sheet. Well, without being punished. And there are leverage ratios for that. We saw a jump in swap spreads on this. Meaning there is more demand for cash treasuries as banks will be able to hold more of them on their balance sheet. However, a lot of the Treasury market reaction yesterday was due to that hot CPI print. Lizzie, if we take a look at the core CPI month on month figure, a 0.4%, that is the hottest reading we've had in this reading since March last year. The first point four we've gotten since then that is tempted the market to push out expectations for a Fed rate cut all the way until December. So we could have a Fed on hold for much of this year. Now, Bloomberg Economics has noted that this jump in inflation has been due to other things, seasonal factors. For instance, this has been the third January in a row, actually, Lizzie, that we've had a hot CPI print. But again, there was a lot of pain in the Treasury market yesterday. If we flip on it, just take a look. There was a near nine basis point rise in the ten year yield as market expects now the Fed to be on pause until December. Okay. Bloomberg's Valerie title with the choppy session post about CPI print on post comments. But we've got plenty more coming up a spring back. Welcome back to Bloomberg Daybreak here at 6:22 a.m. in London. And it is a busy morning for earnings. Just to recap, we've already had Zingerman's results revenue rising on demand for electrification products, posting higher net profit and backing their outlook. And our very own Oliver Crook has been sitting down with the Zeeman CEO, Roland Booth. And take a listen to what he had to say. We saw this growth also in the last quarter of the last year. This is particular growth driven by smart infrastructure, smart infrastructure as a very, very strong foothold in the United States. Is it in building technology, in the kind of equipment, solutions and services, but also electrification? Remember, we invested also in our capacity in the United States for electrification. So is medium voltage, low voltage products, but also any kind of products which go into data centers, fire safety, security, building automation. So we see a strong pull their software, this business that's in the United States, this is growing. It grew again strongly by 15%. So therefore, we have a strong software business. Remember, we also have our acquisitions. There's an acquisition is Altair invested 10 billion into Altair. This we expect the closing in the second half of the year. So therefore, this is a growth momentum which comes and we are there at the right time with a very strong footprint, 40,000 people. The United States is 25% of our revenue coming from there. So that's should really give us a lot of momentum also in the years to come. And I'd like to also get your reaction to the latest sort of tariff action we've had from Donald Trump. Obviously, he sort of began with aluminum and steel. This could obviously expand to other sort of divisions. What is the sort of impact do you think is going to be on Zingerman's and how is it affecting your strategy and how you're looking at this year? So I think the biggest impact is any kind of trade restrictions. They ultimately result in higher inflation first and foremost before the reshuffling. So for Siemens, we are a global company, but with a very, very local footprint. I talked about the United States. I can say the same for for India, for China. We have 30,000 people there, also local manufacturing in all places. So therefore, we would see an impact. But it's not that strong. It's more about how is it impacting the market in total. And first and foremost, second point comes what happens is that since customers see higher tariffs, they of course, they relocate, they value add it. So we believe that could be tailwind for Siemens, because if you want to build a new plant and Siemens is there and you're going to build it in an environment where we have less and less labor or high, high cost labor, you want to automate and digitalize this plant as much as you can. And if you look for an answer to that from technology perspective, come to Siemens. We are leading in automation, we are leading industrial software, but also in industrial AI, we can provide answers to the questions how to ramp up a smaller lot size manufacturing, fully automated. Very good examples. Also with our partners Industrial Corp, how to design virtual PSC, where we are basically reshaping this the way how you automate. So it's a lot of technology in the pipeline which we can help you. And I'd like to also get your insight on what you're seeing in the Chinese market. Obviously, we've been talking about for years waiting for this recovery in China. Do you see any signs of that now or do you think that this is going to be some more sort of stagnation for this year, 2025? So we do see a signed sign there. We see electronic semiconductors coming up. Chemical industry, which is a leading industry, has shows momentum. There also actually in particular in China, automotive industry in other places. This is not so therefore, and the government is taking actions. They want to bring the confidence of the people back, the trigger some actions in order to really get life again into the construction sector. Again, this boosts also confidence. And I believe the whole story about deep sea is also putting a lot of self-confidence into people's minds. So therefore demand will come back. Government is taking actions. It's not a kick start. I would not say that. But we see that this economy is picking up momentum, in particular in the space where we are, which is the investment space. So that was the theme. And CEO Roland Breuer, speaking to Oliver Crook, shares up 12% year to date. So we'll keep an eye on the stock at the open. Meanwhile, in at 7:00 London time, we're going to get the latest UK GDP numbers. Economists are expecting a 0.1% drop after a stagnant third quarter. But this is crucial because it could put the UK back on the brink of recession. And remember, the Bank of England already last week downgraded its growth forecasts for the U.K.. You can see that here. Our reporters also got their hands on a copy of the Office for Budget Responsibilities first draft of its updated growth outlook, another downgrade there. All of which is bad news for Rachel Reeves, because, of course, she has just announced this raft of measures to boost growth that are not going to materialize for decades. It looks like growth, the government's top priority, part of what economists reckon weighed on growth was her gloomy messaging after the election last year. And most importantly, weak growth, of course, impact her headroom and if she runs out of that, she's going to have to cut spending. Given she's ruled out more tax rises or breaking her fiscal rules. But we've got plenty more coming up on the program. We're going to get back to the geopolitics. Trump setting his sights on stopping the war in Ukraine. I'll get you the details next. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. A very good morning. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Lizzie Borden in London. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Asian stocks and the euro gain after President Trump and Putin agreed talks to end the war in Ukraine. Sources tell us European officials were not warned about the phone call. Jay Powell warns Congress there's still more work to do to bring down US inflation after core consumer prices saw the biggest monthly increase since March. We'll bring you the jobs and PPI data later on today. Plus, Japanese media report Honda, A Nissan R to scrap tie up talks as both carmakers report their results. We'll bring you earnings from Europe, including Nestl\u00e9. Well, a very good morning. Welcome to an extremely busy Thursday, both in terms of earnings and geopolitics, checking in on these markets and we've got futures pointing higher on both sides of the Atlantic on these expectations of an end to the war in Ukraine off the back of the US, Russia talks. Asian markets looking past that hotter than expected US CPI print as traders focus on the prospects of peace but also momentum in China Tech. We'll get into that in just a moment. But flipping over to the cross asset picture, the dollar's really been on a roller coaster ride off the back of the CPI print because of these bets of higher rates for longer. But it pared gains yesterday afternoon and now you've got euro dollar that at 1 to 4, up half of a percent as well because of the prospect of peace. But we've got the pound there at 124. Again, looking ahead to UK GDP at the top of the hour, Treasury yields at 4.6% on the ten year and oil down at $74 a barrel, down 8/10 of a percent because maybe the prospect of peace could ease some of these supply concerns. So no shortage of catalysts this morning. But let's get into the Alibaba moves as well, because you are looking at that individual stock currently higher, 6.9%. Now that's pared its some of its earlier gains. It was up 9.1% in Hong Kong at its highest since 2022. But if we put it into context, it's up from the 57, up 57% from the January trough, but still down 59% from the 2021 peak. So this frenzy over Chinese artificial intelligence turning it into a bit of an investor favourite, again, really putting a bit of life into the e-commerce giant, having pretty much sunk into obscurity after this year's long regulatory crackdown. So a surprise reversal of fortunes for Alibaba, which had kind of fallen out of favour, hadn't it, given Beijing's clampdown on the tech behemoths in that country? We also in Asia have breaking earnings from Honda, Of course, this morning we have had a report that Honda and Nissan's board have approved ending the merger talks. So that somewhat overshadowing these numbers. This morning, we have the news of that earnings expecting this morning. Operating income coming in at \u00a5397.3 billion. The estimate was for \u00a5406.9 billion. So a miss on operating income. We are expecting the CEO to hold a briefing on the integration that has been put off the table for now. Officially, Nissan calling off the talks to combine but continuing talks on strategic partnership so that the latest on Hong Kong of course, it also faces the Trump tariff threat. Both Nissan and Honda have extensive manufacturing operations in Mexico. The shares down 8.5% year to date. But let's get back to the geopolitics now. President Trump saying that he has agreed in a phone call with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, to start negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. It reverses three years of US policy on the conflict, with European officials getting no advance warning of that call. Trump says meetings with the Russian president are now being planned. But I'll be dealing with President Putin largely on the phone and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. And we're going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time we'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's Oliver Crook out of Munich. And Ollie, it seems like an absolutely fundamental moment that Trump has spoken to Putin before. Zelensky But what do we know about what they said on that call? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the president, Donald Trump, is really sort of trying to move very, very fast with a number of things. So there's obviously this call with Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, again breaking with precedent of the last several years of the Ukraine conflict from US policy of European policy, and basically just wanting to get things moving. And we knew this was going to a certain degree be Trump's approach, much more pragmatic approach. But what's interesting is it's going at the same time as Pete Hegseth, the US Defense secretary, is here in Europe. You also had Scott Benson, the Secretary Treasury secretary, over in Ukraine, to discuss with Zelensky potentially economic cooperation going forward. So all of these things happening at once. If if Scott Bessen in there in Ukraine, basically what the Trump administration does is it is leaving the door open to continue to support Ukraine if they need to maybe even wrapping it up if Putin doesn't come to the negotiating table, but they want to get paid back. So where how they're going to get paid back potentially in the sort of mineral deposits with Ukraine and sort of opening up the sort of economic ties from the defense side of things. And this was in Brussels with the US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaking yesterday. We don't yet have the Trump plan in terms of what he wants to see the peace plan in Ukraine look like. But we began to get some of the contours from the defense secretary of the United States. Have a listen to what he had to say yesterday. The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops as part of any security guarantee. There will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. So that you get very sort of clearly from the US Defense secretary, no US troops to sort of be in there as a defense keeping force. He really wants the burden to shift from the United States to the Europeans in the sort of long term security of Ukraine. But again, he kept saying the word realistic. What is realistic? What is not realistic? This is an administration that is moving away from the sort of principles, I think, that were guiding the Biden administration into the pragmatics of just trying to get it done. Yeah, an about face from Biden to Trump policy on Ukraine. But how is it being seen in Europe? Is it seen as a capitulation to Putin? Perhaps. I mean, that's one of the great concerns, right. And I think that what we keep hearing from these sort of Europeans and we've heard from the beginning of the war from the Biden administration is basically no decision about Ukraine without Ukraine. Right. That has been the sort of the conversation throughout. Now, we understand that Trump basically sees this as a negotiation between himself and Vladimir Putin. But the other point is that, you know, no decision about Ukraine without Ukraine, perhaps, but there's increasingly seems like there's going to be decisions about Ukraine without the Europeans. I mean, they're getting all of this information as fast as, you know, sort of we are it seems they're not getting briefed on these calls with Putin. They're not getting sort of in the room. So what will be absolutely crucial here in Munich, which is why we're here, is the Munich Security Conference. This is where we're going to actually have really the first high level meetings between the Europeans and the new Trump administration. We have J.D. Vance here. We have Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. We have Keith Kellogg, the special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The question is going to be how much input are the Europeans going to get in this sort of situation? Are they just going to be told basically what Trump is thinking and they need to acquiesce? And it's sort of very awkward because it's not only that, you know, the United States may be acting unilaterally. They're also going to be expecting a lot from the Europeans in terms of security guarantees, paying for the security of Ukraine and potentially, you know, peacekeeping forces within Ukraine. We're talking about potentially European troops within Ukraine after a cease fire deal in order to preserve the peace there. That is something that is going to be very difficult to sell on a national level. I've spoken to senior lawmakers in Germany about this, and they're sort of very reluctant to commit to anything that looks anything like that. Okay. Bloomberg's Oliver Crop bringing all of the threads together for us from Munich ahead of the Munich Security Conference. We thank you. Now let's get back to the earnings story here in Europe. Michelin saying that difficult conditions for the tire maker on the tire market are going to continue in the coming months because of the downturn for the autos industry. This after Europe's biggest tire manufacturer reported sales volumes down 5.1% in the year 2024. I'm pleased to say that I can speak now to Michelin's CFO Eve SHAPIRO, who joins me from Paris. A very good morning to you, Eve. Just take me through these results that you have reported. Hey, good morning, Lizzie. Thank you for having me. Despite the conditions that you describe very well, uh, Michelin posted very strong, very robust results that showed that our overall revenue went down, that we have been able to stabilize our operating margin at 12.6% at constant exchange rates. And we we record the second largest free cash flow in the group history of \u20ac2.2 billion. So that's given the conditions, the volatility of the market, uh, the inflows of Asian tires in anticipation of regulation change or tariffs. Uh, it's a, it's a it's a remarkable performance. Well, yeah, I know you've got plants in Mexico and Canada. So how are Trump's tariffs affecting you? So for the time being, there is no tariff between the US, Mexico and Canada. Michigan employed 20,000 employees in the US. We have 35 factories of which 20 produce styles and roughly 70% of the tires that we are selling in USA are produced in us. On top of that, we have some factories in the USA producing, for example, mining tires that I exported all over the world. So our US operations are of course integrated with our Canadian and Mexican operations. We just have to factor in in Mexico, in Freon, in Canada. Our largest operations by far in North America are in the US. Yeah. I mean, your CEO's talked about investing more in the US, possibly at the expense of the European size, to counter these tariff threats. Can you, can you give us more detail on that strategy and what you're planning to do there? No. I wish you did not say that. It will be at the expense of the European investments we have. What you said is that it's given the competitive challenge that we are facing in Europe, energy cost, labour cost, or the whole. It's a business taxation and the arraignment process. A lot of norms, uh, it's difficult to export from Europe and in us we have, as I said, we have very large operations. We are constantly investing to renew our tools in North America. And what Flor was saying is that maybe we have to prioritize, uh, some project in the US versus Mexico or Canada, but not at the expense of European operations. But so difficult to export from Europe, but within Europe. What's the demand outlook for EVs looking like? So the market, the EV market last year was stable, was stalling in India, in Europe, in overall passenger car market for original equipment that dropped, uh, by 7% over the year. Uh, and that showed that we have a, we have been experiment in Europe, uh, tough market conditions where at the same time all original equipment, uh, segments were well down. Uh, and particularly at the expense in automotive or other of electric vehicles because mostly because of the cost of electric vehicle first, but as well because consumers sometimes are a bit lost about what, what, what kind of a, uh, power engine they should, uh, they should buy, uh, which triggered these difficulties. On top of that, some countries have move back and forth regarding the incentive for electric vehicles. I've really got to talk to you this morning. Eve shopper, CFO of Michelin. Thank you. Coming up on the program, Wall Street banks are planning to expand their crypto offerings amid Trump's embrace of the industry. We're going to speak to the managing partner from venture capital firm Stillman. So do stay with us for that conversation coming up next. This is Bloomberg. The Stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework that addresses stablecoin risk directly, fully and narrowly. This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Wallace, speaking there on some of Wall Street's biggest banks are planning to ramp up their involvement in the crypto industry. This as banks are betting that the Trump administration is pro crypto policy will lead to a wave of IPO share sales and convertible bonds. While we can talk now about all of this with Elise Khalid, who is managing partner at Bitcoin focused venture capital firm. Still, Mark, really good to have you back, Elise, on DAYBREAK. Europe. You heard those comments from wallet that Stablecoins have the potential, he says, to maintain and expand the international role of the dollar. What do you make of them? I think that's absolutely correct. And the year has started with significant announcements for stablecoin activity in the crypto sphere with TETHER announcing on January 30th that they plan to launch Usdc on Bitcoin and on lightning. That of course is possible via the Taproot Assets Protocol, developed by Smart portfolio company Lightning Labs with contributions from the broader open source developer community. And the protocol itself was made possible by a recent upgrade to Bitcoin protocol. Taproot. And just as we've seen this kind of about face from the Trump administration, from the Biden administration on Ukraine policy, as we were discussing earlier, you're also seeing the Trump administration embracing crypto in a way that you might say the Biden administration did not. We're still, though, at least waiting for more clarity on regulation. What would you like to see? What would be the most beneficial? Regulatory clarity is certainly overdue in the Bitcoin field. And of course the integrity, integrity of regulatory bodies is also important. It's stability that benefits Bitcoin startups, and as startups are correlated with Bitcoin's price and that startups drive adoption expand Bitcoin's utility. Regulatory stability is also important for Bitcoin. And as I said, Bitcoin begins the year with incredible momentum. There are several forces behind that. So the the transition of tether from crypto protocols like Tron saw an end to theory and soon to come to Bitcoin and Bitcoin's Lightning Network is significant for bitcoin because of the incredible activity that Tether and Stablecoins have seen on other protocols in 2020. For 400 million users worldwide use tether to transact over 10 trillion in volume across chains that are frankly less efficient than what's provided by Bitcoin and Bitcoin's Lightning Network. And so for those new users coming to Bitcoin and Bitcoin's Lightning Network to access Stablecoins to transact what they will, what they will benefit in this integration is instant settlement time and much lower transaction fees. So where fees have been ranging recently between $0.04 and over $10, with fees spiking much higher than that based on activity with lightning, what users will find is instant settlement at a fraction of a cent, and that's consistent even as activity scales now for tether the benefits of. I just wanted to say, given, you know, the uncertainty about regulation you are seeing and we're showing it here, a bit of a lackluster run for Bitcoin over the past week or so. We're not the $100,000 mark where we were previously. What do you think could get it past that again? Well, that's exactly right. And I think that reflects the importance of the broader economy for Bitcoin. And so as we've seen instability in the economy, questions around general global stability and the the sort of position of regulatory bodies in, you know, within the United States, that uncertainly uncertainty translates and affects Bitcoin. It translates to Bitcoin. Of course, Bitcoin's price is significantly up over the past 12 months. And so even though we've seen some instability and uncertainty that's affected the economy as a whole and and Bitcoin itself, it's still Bitcoin's performance has been incredibly strong. The the ramifications of regulatory clarity are not just important for Bitcoin's price, but also for the adoption of Bitcoin. One of the areas that we've seen that emerge is an enterprise adoption for Bitcoin and the Treasury. Yeah. At least clean managing partner. It's still not always good to talk to you. We thank you. And we'll get back to that macro picture in just a moment. So do stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Its base reasoning is very good. In fact, the book, even without fine tuning graph three the base model is better than not to so. So we're really in the final stages of publishing group three. Probably it gets released in about a week or two. So pretty soon I think the evidence is there in that arena has gotten this far while having at least a sort of dual profit nonprofit role. What they're trying to do now is completely delete the nonprofit and and that seems really going too far. So that was the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk there discussing Openai in a conversation at the World Government Summit in Dubai invokes G.M. BERSET. She joins us now in Dubai with more. Jomana, what else did Elon Musk have to say? Yeah, well, it was one of the signature panels this year at the World Government Summit on day three, no less. A conversation between Elon Musk, who dealt in virtually to the summit and the UAE air minister that was eminent. And they spoke about a whole bunch of things, including Doge. What Elon Musk plan is with the reduction of the size of some of these US agencies, and he actually said we need to delete entire agencies and many of them. So again, reiterating what he's been saying the last couple of weeks and that the size of the US government needs to be shrunk. But then some comments about open air as well. Now, I didn't ask him directly about the bids that they must consortium put in for open air. But what he did say, what Mutt said, is that Openai has shifted away from its origins. It started as a non-profit, an open source model. It's moved away from that and he would like to see it return to back to what it was, but didn't actually touch on the fact that he put in a bid for it. And of course, our very own Tom Mackenzie spoke to some Altman the other day. They outright rejected any bid from Elon Musk and said that it was coming from a place of insecurity. He didn't actually touch on that on the panel. But very interesting to hear from Elon Musk at the World Government Summit. He also made a big announcement. They're opening up a loop, a loop. It's a buy loop for transport systems over here in the UAE. Yep. Flew past chairman of us actually, with a round up of what Elon Musk had to say in Dubai. The opening trades coming up next with Guy Christine on it, taking you all the way to the open.

Ukraine wasn't invited. A ceasefire could also be on the way, Trump said, as he offered up new details about vision for a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\"I'm just here to try and get peace,\" Trump told reporters. \"I don't care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.\"\nTalks to end the Russia-Ukraine war are now officially underway, Trump said earlier on Wednesday, as he held back-to-back calls with both countries' leaders and appointed a negotiating team to work on a resolution to the nearly three-year-old conflict.\nTrump held his first known call since he took office with Putin after playing coy for weeks about whether one had taken place. He also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he met with in December.\nThe conversations signaled a new intensity and pace in the U.S. efforts to end the war almost a month into the president's term and less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's Feb. 24, 2022 invasion. During the 2024 campaign, Trump said he'd end the war as soon as he was elected. More recently he has vowed to have the war wrapped up within the next six months.\nOn a trip to Europe, his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, separately suggested that Ukraine would have to concede Crimea, an area of Ukraine that was seized by Russia in 2014 prior to the current conflict, and its aspirations to NATO membership in order to reach an agreement.\n\"I think probably that's true,\" Trump concurred in the Oval Office. \"I don't think it's practical to have it.\"\nMore:Trump said he'd quickly end Russia's war on Ukraine. But it's proving tough.\nThe Kremlin said in a statement that Putin invited Trump to visit Russia during their call. Trump suggested in a statement that a U.S. visit by Putin, whom the previous administration stopped speaking to as a result of the war, was also on the table.\n\"We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.\nHe said he'd also consider going to Ukraine, after he was asked about the possibility by a reporter in the Oval Office.\nTrump also appeared to shake up his negotiating team.\nHe said in a social media post that he was putting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA director John Ratcliffe, national security advisor Michael Waltz and his special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff in charge of the talks. Left off the list was special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, who had been leading the talks.\nThe White House said Wednesday that Kellogg, who is headed to Kyiv this week, is still part of the administration and thanked him for his help in getting the discussion to this point \u2212 without explaining why Trump made the change.\nMore:Hegseth tells Europe a return to Ukraine's pre-Russia invasion borders is 'unrealistic'\nIt was also Witkoff who brought home American school teacher Marc Fogel from Moscow a day prior. Fogel was part of an exchange with Russia that the White House did not fully detail.\nTrump's call with Putin took place as members of his Cabinet, including Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance, visited Europe on inaugural trips in their positions. Vance and Rubio will meet with Zelenskyy on Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the White House says.\nHegseth's comments came during an address to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, which he used to lay out Trump's approach to the war.\n\"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\" he told U.S. allies. \"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"\nHe also told allies that the U.S. does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine \"is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement\" and that security guarantees for the country must be backed by a separate group of European and non-European troops, who could be deployed as peacekeepers.\n\"To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,\" Hegseth said.\nTrump told reporters later \"it certainly would seem to be unlikely\" that Ukraine would get all of its land back. \"Some of it will come back,\" he added.\nHis comments came after Zelenskyy said in a Tuesday interview with The Guardian that Europe on its own could not offer security guarantees that would be acceptable.\n\u201cSecurity guarantees without America are not real security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy said.", "title": "Trump starts Ukraine peace talks as he and Putin plan Saudi meet - USA TODAY", "score": 0.6191726, "published_date": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:42:41 GMT", "content": "Trump starts Ukraine peace talks as he and Putin plan Saudi meet WASHINGTON \u2212 President Donald Trump says he expects to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia in the near future to discuss an end to his nation's war on Ukraine.

Video](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368828020112)\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth says it is 'unlikely' U.S. will send troops to Ukraine\nSecretary Hegseth made the remarks during a press conference in Poland on Friday ahead of Vice President JD Vance's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration forged ahead with its foreign policy priorities in meetings and calls with heads of state and advanced discussions surrounding the end of the Russia-Ukraine war this week.\nTrump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where leaders agreed to launch negotiations to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\"We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations,\" Trump posted to Truth Social Wednesday after speaking with Putin. \"We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.\"\n\"I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful,\" Trump said.\nAdditionally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday, and Vice President JD Vance also met with Zelenskyy Friday at the Munich Security Conference.\nTRUMP SAYS RUSSIA AGREES TO \u2018IMMEDIATELY BEGIN\u2019 NEGOTIATIONS TO END WAR IN UKRAINE\nThen-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet at Trump Tower in New York City, New York, Sept. 27, 2024.\u00a0 (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has come under scrutiny for the negotiations, fielding criticism that Ukraine is being pressured to give in to concessions after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that it wasn\u2019t realistic for Ukraine to regain its pre-war borders with Russia.\n\"Putin is gonna pocket this and ask for more,\" Brett Bruen, director of global engagement under former President Barack Obama, told Fox News Digital.\nBut Hegseth shut down comments like these, and told NATO members in Brussels on Thursday: \"Any suggestion that President Trump is doing anything other than negotiating from a position of strength is, on its face, ahistorical and false.\"\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and Trump vowed on the campaign trail in 2024 that he would work to end the conflict if elected again.\nHere\u2019s what also happened this week at the White House:\nMeeting Jordan\u2019s king\nTrump welcomed Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House Tuesday, a visit that comes amid contentious discussions between the U.S. and Arab nations about relocating Palestinian refugees to Jordan and other neighboring Arab countries to rebuild Gaza.\nTrump unveiled plans on Feb. 4 that the U.S. would seek to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip in a \"long-term ownership position\" to deliver stability to the region during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s proposal prompted swift backlash from Arab countries, including Jordan, and Egypt announced plans on Sunday for an emergency Arab Summit to discuss \"new and dangerous developments\" regarding the resettling of Palestinians on Feb. 27.\nTRUMP MEETS WITH JORDAN'S KING AMID TENSE TALKS ABOUT RESETTLING PALESTINIANS\nWhen asked how he felt about Trump's plans for the future of Gaza, Abdullah remained tight-lipped and said he would wait for the Egyptians to take the lead on a proposal moving forward as they negotiate with the U.S.\n\"I think let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the president and not get ahead of us,\" Abdullah said.\nAbdullah did reveal plans to accept 2,000 sick Palestinian children to Jordan.\n\"I think one of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 children that are either cancer children or in a very ill state, to Jordan as quickly as possible,\" Abdullah said. \"And then wait for \u2026 the Egyptians to present their plan on how we can work with the president to work on the cause of challenges.\"\nDenuclearization talks with China, Russia\nTrump floated a joint meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin, claiming he wants all countries to move toward denuclearization.\nTrump on Thursday told reporters he plans to advance these denuclearization talks once \"we straighten it all out\" in the Middle East and Ukraine, comments that come as the U.S., Russia and Ukraine are actively pursuing negotiations to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\"There\u2019s no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons, we already have so many,\" Trump said Thursday at the White House. \"You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they\u2019re building nuclear weapons.\"\n\"We\u2019re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,\" he said.\nThe U.S. is projected to spend approximately $756 billion on nuclear weapons between 2023 and 2032, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released in 2023.\nCuts to federal workforce\nTrump signed an executive order Tuesday instructing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to coordinate with federal agencies and execute massive cuts in federal government staffing numbers.\nThe order will instruct DOGE and federal agencies to work together to \"significantly\" shrink the size of the federal government and limit hiring new employees, according to a White House fact sheet on the order. Specifically, agencies must not hire more than one employee for every four that leave their federal post.\nTRUMP SIGNS ORDER INSTRUCTING DOGE TO MASSIVELY CUT FEDERAL WORKFORCE\nElon Musk and President Donald Trump talk about DOGE's efforts to investigate wasteful U.S. government spending from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 11, 2025. (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)\nAgencies will also be instructed to \"undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force\" and evaluate ways to eliminate or combine agency functions that aren't legally required.\nThe order builds on another directive Trump signed after his inauguration implementing a federal hiring freeze, as well as an initiative from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management offering more than two million federal civilian employees buyouts if they leave their jobs or return to work in person. The White House told Fox News Digital Thursday that more than 75,000 employees have accepted the buyout.\nEliminate the penny?\nTrump unveiled plans Sunday to halt production of the penny \u2014 but getting that initiative underway requires a few additional steps and possibly congressional approval.\nAdditionally, while Trump said he instructed the Treasury Department to stop minting them due to their high costs, supporters of the penny claim it\u2019s wiser to evaluate changes to the nickel instead.\n\"For far too long, the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. \"This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"\nIn fact, producing pennies is even more expensive than Trump\u2019s numbers. It costs nearly 3.69 cents to mint a single penny, according to a 2024 U.S. Mint report. The coins are primarily made of zinc and then covered in copper.\nWhile the waters are a little murky on the next steps, experts say Congress likely would need to become involved and pass legislation to fulfill Trump\u2019s wishes.\n\"The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\" Robert Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, told the Northeastern Global News.\nFox News' Emma Colton and Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\nDiana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering the White House.\nMore from Politics\n3 hours ago\nFederal department slashes millions in contracts, including $230K for 'Brazilian forest and gender consultant'\n7 hours ago\nJudge extends order blocking Musk\u2019s DOGE team from Treasury payment system\n9 hours ago\nDOGE says it dug up another $1.9 billion in taxpayer money 'misplaced' by Biden admin\n9 hours ago\nJustice Department moves to drop case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams\nFox News Politics\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\nArrives Weekdays\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

One of the sources said the meeting will take place in the coming days.\nThe sources declined to say which Russian officials would be in attendance, but CNN has previously reported the Kremlin is assembling a high-level negotiating team to engage in direct talks with the US, including top-level political, intelligence and economic figures, and Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian official who played a key behind-the-scenes role in a recent US prisoner release deal.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nPresident Donald Trump said earlier this week that negotiations to end the nearly three-year Ukraine war will start \u201cimmediately\u201d after holding a \u201clengthy and highly productive\u201d phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call, which was the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul also confirmed the plans during an interview with Politico at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, saying, \u201cRubio and Waltz and Witkoff (are) being dispatched to Saudi to talk to the Ukrainians and the Russians about Ukraine.\u201d\nTrump indicated earlier this week that he could meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia in the \u201cnot-too-distant future,\u201d but cautioned that no formal decision had been made. \u201cWe think we\u2019re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,\u201d Trump said after he spoke to Putin by phone Wednesday.\nThe president indicated that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions. Witkoff also said the Saudi crown prince was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel this week.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe State Department had previously announced Rubio would travel to Saudi Arabia in the coming days as part of a larger trip to Munich and the Middle East. Rubio, who landed in Israel on Saturday, held a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier in the day, the State Department said in a statement.\n\u201cThe Secretary re-affirmed President Trump\u2019s commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine,\u201d State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. \u201cIn addition, they discussed the opportunity to potentially work together on a number of other bilateral issues.\u201d\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry characterized the Lavrov-Rubio conversation as \u201ca mutual commitment to cooperate on current international issues, including the resolution of the situation around Ukraine\u201d as well the Middle East crisis. The two agreed to maintain regular contact, including to prepare for a high-level Russian-American meeting, the ministry said.\nTrump\u2019s envoy says Russia must make concessions\nRubio\u2019s call comes as the Trump administration\u2019s Russia-Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said Saturday that Moscow would have to make concessions to end the war in Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe concessions would primarily involve territorial matters and possibly the renunciation of the use of force, Kellogg told a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference.\nPutin is \u201cnot going to downsize his military forces,\u201d the American diplomat said, but the US hopes \u201cto force\u201d him into actions he is \u201cuncomfortable with.\u201d\nKellogg said the US could achieve this by disrupting Russia\u2019s recently formed alliances \u2014 such as those with Iran, North Korea and China \u2014 that didn\u2019t exist just a few years ago.\nKellogg also said the US could put pressure on Putin\u2019s oil revenue through stricter sanctions.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat is driving Russia? It\u2019s really a petrostate. Seventy percent of the money they are getting to fund this war is coming from petro, oil and gas,\u201d Kellogg noted, adding that the US must start employing sanctions that break Moscow\u2019s \u201ceconomic back.\u201d\nTrump has previously demurred when asked what concessions Russia should have to make to end the war in Ukraine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what\u2019s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot. Maybe they won\u2019t. It\u2019s all dependent on what is going to happen,\u201d he said Thursday.\nKellogg also said Saturday that Europeans will not be at the negotiating table when trying to reach a solution to the war in Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe answer is no,\u201d Kellogg said at an event on the margins of the Munich Security Conference.\nThe Ukrainians will be present \u201cof course,\u201d Kellogg said. \u201cIt would be foolish to say (Ukraine) wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nAs for the Europeans, Kellogg said that he comes from a \u201cschool of realism\u201d and that looking back at the previous Minsk II agreement, \u201cthere was a lot of people at the table that really had no ability to execute some type of peace process, and it failed miserably.\u201d\nThe Minsk II agreement was negotiated in the Belarusian capital in 2015 in a bid to end a bloody 10-month conflict in eastern Ukraine. The rare diplomatic effort brought together leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, aiming to restore peace in regions seized by pro-Russian separatists in 2014. Despite its ambitious goals, the agreement faced challenges in implementation, ultimately failing to bring lasting stability to the region.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nKellogg described the current efforts at negotiating a peace deal as \u201cdual track.\u201d\n\u201cYou got a Russian track going on. At the same time, we\u2019ve got a Ukrainian track going on,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you look at the news you see that you got the (Trump) envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff is involved because he\u2019s got the Russian line. And I\u2019m working American-Ukrainian allied line as well. We\u2019re doing that for speed.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN\u2019s Alex Marquardt and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\nAdvertisement\nAbout Our Ads\nSolve the daily Crossword\n41,377 people played the daily Crossword recently.

Surfacing contractors saw the steepest decline on December at 14.7%, followed by bricklaying at 13.2%, largely due to weather conditions. Other trades proved more resilient to the seasonal dip, with equipment and operator hire seeing only a 2% reduction, while insulation and plumbing limited their decreases to 3.8%.\nHudson Contract managing director Ian Anfield said: \u201cJanuary is historically slower due to a staggered return to work. Tradespeople typically maximise their hours in December to boost earnings before Christmas, knowing they\u2019ll have a couple of weeks off afterward. This year\u2019s challenging weather conditions particularly hit outdoor trades \u2013 you can\u2019t work with anything that\u2019s got water in it when you\u2019ve got heavy rain, snow and low temperatures, which is why bricklayers were hit harder than plumbers who can work inside or are busy fixing boilers.\u201d\nHe said that the strong year-on-year growth was likely a combination of sustained demand and the ongoing shortage of workers. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing that tight household budgets mean people are less likely to take extended breaks during bad weather \u2013 they\u2019re keen to get back to earning. And importantly, order books have proven more resilient than media headlines might suggest with the housing sector still building, albeit with phased plot releases on some schemes that a couple of years ago would have been sold out off-plan.\u201d\nGot a story?

The previous best quarter for UK manufacturing was Q2 2023, when output totalled \u00a3153.9bn.\nThe value of food production (\u00a328.4bn) was 8.3% higher in Q4 2024 than in the same period of 2023, partly due to productivity gains worth \u00a32.15bn.\nIncreased food output pushed the total value of UK manufacturing output in 2024 to \u00a3609.2bn, up on 2023\u2019s \u00a3607.6bn. This 0.26% increase in production was lower than growth in previous years and was achieved despite a 19,000 reduction in the number of people in the UK manufacturing workforce.\nWhile output in other manufacturing subsectors was lower in Q4 2024 than Q4 2023, several reversed a summer slump in activity to grow again the final in three months of the year:\nThe value of motor vehicles & transport equipment produced in the UK increased by \u00a34.48bn between Q3 and Q4 2024, recording a 15.9% increase in productivity.\nUK manufacturers producing computer, electronic & electrical products boosted output by \u00a3578m (5.7%) between Q3 and Q4 2024.\nOutput for UK manufacturers specialising in textiles, apparel & leather products, paper, paper products & printed material, and metals, metal products & machinery also increased by around 1% quarter-on-quarter.\nChris Iveson, CEO at FourJaw Manufacturing Analytics, commented: \u201cUK manufacturers have remained resilient in the face of significant headwinds. They focused on what they could influence and boosted output and productivity in perhaps the most challenging year since 2020. Despite skills shortages and a shrinking workforce, UK manufacturers continue to deliver growth and drive productivity with technology.

Credit: Nato.\nThe UK announced another wave of military assistance to Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces valued at \u00a3150m ($187.5m) as the nation led its first Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) at Nato\u2019s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium on 12 February 2025.\nComprising drones, tanks, and armoured vehicles, the British package will be delivered to Ukraine by the end of spring this year.\nHowever, Britain\u2019s show of solidarity with the wartorn country, embroiled in a war with Russia that approaches its third anniversary, has fallen under the radar. The aid went largely unnoticed being overshadowed by the new American position on Ukraine.\nUS steps back from Europe\nThe US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, taking a back seat in Brussels, delivered a hard line to his 50 counterparts that derided the \u201cimbalanced relationship\u201d in which he objected the United States\u2019s leadership in propping up Ukraine\u2019s chances against invading Russian forces.\nThis drama escalated when, that same day, US President Donald Trump revealed on his social media platform Truth that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had called to enter negotiations for an end to the war in Ukraine, in which, the two had initially excluded Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nNevertheless, British \u2013 and European \u2013 aid continues to flow to Ukraine despite American disdain for the purportedly feeble efforts they make compared to the leader of the free world.\nHow well do you really know your competitors?\nAccess the most comprehensive Company Profiles on the market, powered by GlobalData.

Although, the Ministry of Defence did not release details of the particular variant.\nCurrently, the most recent variant of the tank is the T-72B3M, also referred to as T-72B4, developed by the Russian Uralvagonzavod Research and production Corporation.\nPictured: a T-72B3 tank firing from its main gun, the 2A46M5 125mm cannon. Credit: JSC Research and Production Corporation Uralvagonzavod via Army Technology.\nHowever, it is more likely that the UK will finance a developed capability for existing T-72 tanks from countries close to Ukraine, such as the Czech Republic or Poland.\nThese two countries are looking \u00a0to replace the Soviet-era platforms with Leopard 2A4s and A8s respectively. According to GlobalData intelligence, this would involve advancing the T-72M1 or M4 main battle tanks, of which the Czech Republic have 119 and Poland 124 units.\nIt should be noted, however, that such ground platforms have become bait for drone warfare on the battlefields of Eastern Europe \u2013 no matter what manner of protection the vehicles may have. Loitering munitions, flown by First-Person View uncrewed aerial systems, are more mobile and manoeuvrable than oversized and costly tanks.\nTo counter this enduring weakness, the British Army recently revealed that they are trialling \u2018cope cages\u2019 on its Challenger 2 tanks. These tests are examining areas like vehicle function and sightlines, crew ingress and egress, stowage, and maintenance tasks. In addition, technical trials are ongoing to determine threat impact and implications to the host platform\u2019s signature.\nCultivating commercial relations\nOn 13 February 2025, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte referred to the forthcoming peace negotiations, facilitated by the Trump administration, between Ukraine and Russia:\n\u201cWe all want Ukraine to be in the best possible position when those talks start, to make sure that they can be concluded successfully. And as also Pete Hegseth said yesterday\u2026 it is crucial that whatever comes out of those talks, it is durable.\u201d\nWhat this durable peace might look like will likely be a point of contention in the Euro-Atlantic relationship. The US may be more ready to accept Russian conditions than their European partners, and certainly more so than Ukraine, an active participant in the war unwilling to be shoved out of the process.\nFor Europe, making Ukraine strong may involve bestowing, more than before, all its defence industrial might on Ukraine. This is a position taken up by Andriy Dovbenko, principal of the UK-Ukraine TechExchange.\n\u201cThe UK, which has now been handed the reins for the [UDCG], focused on strengthening Ukraine\u2019s security, must step up its efforts. And fast. However, Ukraine may represent both the challenge and the solution,\u201d Dovbenko observed.\n\u201cWe must improve commercial relationships with [Ukrainian] companies to ensure they survive beyond the war and can be used to protect civilians, government, and critical infrastructure much further afield than Ukraine.\n\u201cWhile Ukraine fights to save lives and secure the country\u2019s future, it has also been building the future of the European defence industry, which must now be put into action by its allies.\u201d\nAdditional reporting from Richard Thomas.\nSign up for our daily news round-up!\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nSign up\nShare\nCopy Link\nShare on X\nShare on Linkedin\nShare on Facebook\nSign up for our daily news round-up!\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\nclose\nclose\nSign up to the newsletter: In Brief\nI would also like to subscribe to:\nGlobal Defence Technology : Army Technology Focus (monthly)\nThematic Take (monthly)\nVisit our Privacy Policy for more information about our services, how we may use, process and share your personal data, including information on your rights in respect of your personal data and how you can unsubscribe from future marketing communications.

(Johanna Geron, Pool Photo via AP)\nExpand\nBy Lorne Cook\nUPDATED: February 12, 2025 at 8:29 AM CST\nBRUSSELS \u2014 U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine\u2019s government.\nHegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth\u2019s predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.\nOver nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.\nNo decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.\nHegseth wasn\u2019t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.\nHis trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won\u2019t stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it\u2019s costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.\nSome U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine\u2019s security going forward.\nWashington\u2019s 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump\u2019s new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.\nNATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.\nUkraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.\nHowever, a third of members still haven\u2019t reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.\nSpeaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn\u2019t commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d\nHe said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.\nNATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.\nOriginally Published: February 12, 2025 at 5:27 AM CST\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\n6 men accused of kidnapping family from Chicago townhouse and forcing a transfer of $15 million in cryptocurrency\n6 men accused of kidnapping family from Chicago townhouse and forcing a transfer of $15 million in cryptocurrency\nColumn: Worst Super Bowl ever?

In a social media post that upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine, the Republican disclosed a call between the two leaders and said they would \u201cwork together, very closely.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said Zelenskyy and Trump also had a phone conversation.\nTaken together, the statements by Trump and Hegseth offered the clearest look yet at how the new administration might try to end Europe's largest land war in generations.\nHegseth\u2019s warning to Ukraine that it should abandon its NATO bid and its push to reclaim all Russian-occupied territory signaled starkly to Kyiv that the administration\u2019s view of a potential settlement is remarkably close to Moscow\u2019s vision. Putin has declared that any peace deal must ensure that Ukraine gives up its NATO ambitions and withdraws its troops from the four regions that Russia annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured.\nIn sweeping remarks to allies eager to hear how much continued support Washington intends to provide to the Ukrainian government, Hegseth indicated that Trump is determined to get Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine, including a possible peacekeeping force that would not include U.S. troops.\nMaking the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, the defense secretary also said the force should not have Article 5 protections, which could require the U.S. or the 31 other nations of the NATO alliance to come to the aid of those forces if they are attacked by Russian forces.\nkAm%96 D64C6E2CJVD 4@>>6?ED H6C6 DFC6 E@ 5:> &<C2:?6\u2019D 9@A6D @7 >2<:?8 :ED6=7 H9@=6 282:? 2?5 E@ 4@>A=:42E6 E2=<D =2E6C E9:D H66< 36EH66? +6=6?D<JJ 2?5 &]$] ':46 !C6D:56?E ys '2?46 2?5 @E96C D6?:@C p>6C:42? @77:4:2=D 2E k2 9C67lQ9EEADi^^2A?6HD]4@>^2CE:4=6^>F?:49\\D64FC:EJ\\4@?76C6?46\\FD\\?2E@\\ECF>A\\_a2ba33dgh5cd25g`62a`c`2ac`4_c5aQm2 >2;@C D64FC:EJ D64FC:EJ 4@?76C6?46 :? |F?:49k^2m]k^Am\nkAm\u201c%96 &?:E65 $E2E6D 5@6D ?@E 36=:6G6 E92E }p%~ >6>36CD9:A 7@C &<C2:?6 :D 2 C62=:DE:4 @FE4@>6 @7 2 ?68@E:2E65 D6EE=6>6?E[\u201d w68D6E9 D2:5[ 2D zJ:G\u2019D 324<6CD 82E96C65 2E }p%~ 9625BF2CE6CD 7@C 2 >66E:?8 E@ 5CF> FA >@C6 2C>D 2?5 2>>F?:E:@? 7@C E96 H2C[ H9:49 H:== D@@? 6?E6C :ED 7@FCE9 J62C]k^Am\nkAmp== ba 2==:6D >FDE 28C66 7@C 2 4@F?ECJ E@ ;@:? }p%~[ >62?:?8 E92E 6G6CJ >6>36C 92D 2 G6E@]k^Am\nkAm\u201cx?DE625[ 2?J D64FC:EJ 8F2C2?E66 >FDE 36 324<65 3J 42A23=6 tFC@A62? 2?5 ?@?\\tFC@A62?

[+] engagement and targeted support to ensure women thrive in education, careers and entrepreneurship.\nGetty Images\nAs we celebrate International Women in STEM Day today, it\u2019s time to face up to a stark reality - even in 2025, women are still drastically underrepresented across STEM professions. Despite years of effort, the numbers remain dismal. Women make up only 30% of the STEM workforce in the UK, with even fewer in high-growth sectors like computer science (23%) and engineering (21%). These figures underscore the systemic issues - such as unconscious bias, limited access to networks, lack of role models and societal pressures - that continue to hinder women\u2019s participation and advancement in STEM careers.\nThe challenges don\u2019t stop at representation. Women in STEM are often subjected to higher levels of harassment and underrepresentation in leadership roles, which further compounds the challenges they face. Economic barriers, restricted access to education, and regressive gender norms create additional hurdles. Despite the attention the issue has received in recent years, the figures speak for themselves. To close the gender gap, we need more than just encouragement and funding - this isn\u2019t an issue we can simply throw money at to solve. We need bold, systemic change that supports women throughout their education, careers and entrepreneurial journeys.\nThis issue goes beyond fairness and justice. Underrepresentation of women in entrepreneurial circles is costing the UK dearly in lost economic potential. The Alison Rose Review shows that if women started and scaled businesses at the same rate as men, the UK economy could grow by \u00a3250 billion - an opportunity we cannot afford to ignore.\nEarly engagement and systemic change\nThe gender gap in STEM isn\u2019t confined to the workplace. Women are underrepresented at every stage - from education to entrepreneurship. The journey to closing this gap begins in education, where many girls develop the perception that STEM subjects aren't for them. Research shows that 36% of girls say science is not for them, with 57% citing a lack of enjoyment and 38% feeling they aren\u2019t good at the subjects, while only 20% of boys feel the same. Initiatives like the UK\u2019s STEM Ambassador programme and Million Women Mentors are crucial in challenging these perceptions early, encouraging girls to engage with STEM subjects and providing role models to boost their confidence.\nBut early engagement is just the beginning. Once women enter the workforce, they continue to face barriers, such as unconscious bias, limited access to networks, and the lack of role models, which limit their ability to advance in STEM careers and entrepreneurship. This is evident in the stark underrepresentation of women in leadership roles, as well as the persisting funding disparities which highlight that female-founded businesses receive only 2% of global venture capital funding. In the UK, women-owned businesses represent just 18% of SMEs, and limited access to capital and networks restricts their growth potential.\nMORE FOR YOU\n### Arizona Plane Crash: Here\u2019s What We Know As Jets Collide At Scottsdale Airport\n### WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On February 10, 2025\n### DOJ Asks Prosecutors To Dismiss Charges Against NYC Mayor Eric Adams\nSupporting female founders\nAddressing these funding and support gaps requires more than just raising awareness - it demands tangible action. Initiatives like Bruntwood SciTech\u2019s Female Founders Incubator are already making a difference. Across Leeds and Manchester, founders have secured over \u00a3200,000 in investment, won 15 industry awards and created new jobs. With the incubator\u2019s support, several female-led startups have also secured over \u00a31 million to scale their businesses. By providing mentorship, networking and over \u00a320,000 in growth support, these programmes are proving the power of targeted interventions to level the playing field for female entrepreneurs.\nHowever, the broader challenge remains. The real test is ensuring long-term, scalable support for women in STEM and entrepreneurship. The UK Government\u2019s \u00a32.6 billion commitment through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund offers an opportunity to continue fostering these initiatives, alongside further rounds of the Innovative UK Women in Innovation programme, which has been instrumental in supporting female entrepreneurs through funding and mentorship. But lasting change requires collaboration across the public and private sectors. The corporate world has a crucial role to play - establishing mentorship programmes, improving access to funding, and ensuring workplace policies promote gender equity.\nA call for collective action\nAs we celebrate International Women in STEM Day, it's clear that closing the gender gap requires collective action. We need a comprehensive strategy that connects with women and girls from an early age, keeps them engaged with STEM subjects, and supports them through fulfilling careers and entrepreneurial opportunities.\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher - not just for the women directly affected, but for the broader economy and society. We need to foster an ecosystem that actively supports women in STEM and entrepreneurship, recognising their contributions as vital to driving economic growth and innovation.\nLet\u2019s not leave this potential untapped. By committing to systemic change and targeted support, we can unlock the immense value that gender diversity brings to the STEM fields and beyond.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\nKath Mackay\nFollowing\nEditorial Standards\nForbes Accolades\nJoin The Conversation\nComments\nOne Community.

[+] Silicon Valley town of Sunnyvale, California, October 28, 2018. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\nAmazon and Google are fighting gallantly to remain relevant. Whether or not they will remain relevant is a question that hundreds of billions worth of investment will answer.\nTo which more than a few readers will ask what could possibly be meant by the above comment. Among other things Amazon and Google respectively dominate shopping and search on the fact of life that we know as the internet. The very notion that they must fight for relevance vandalizes common sense. That would certainly be the view of federal officials who've harassed both companies with all manner of antitrust lawsuits in recent years.\nOf course, what\u2019s lost on federal officials constrained by the known is that when it comes to commerce in the most economically dynamic country on earth, the present is always the past. Equity markets tell us why.\nTo investors, the present is already \"priced\" in the marketplace. They want to know what corporations will do in the future, and in particular what the prominent businesses of the present will do to remain relevant in the future.\nAll of which explains Google's 2025 plans for $75 billion in largely AI-related investment alongside Amazon's objective to put $100 billion to work. Hopefully the $75 and $100 billion exist as sizable reminders that whatever the opinion of antitrust officials in the federal government, Amazon and Google aren't at all operating in monopolistic fashion. If anything, they're working in startup fashion in a desperate search to discover a future that is far from certain.\nAbout all the money they're putting to work, what choice do Amazon and Google have? Other prominent American technological names like Meta and Microsoft are similarly investing enormous sums in AI, AI-adjacent, and other future-seeking endeavors, not to mention the vast sums being put to work by venture capitalists in startups that feel they see what's ahead more clearly than do the established players in technology. The VC investment is particularly important to contemplate.\nMORE FOR YOU\nMost Sophisticated Gmail Attacks Ever\u2014FBI Says: Do Not Click Anything\nSony Reveals Compensation For All PS Plus Players After PSN Outage\n\u2018MAGA Is Unforgiving\u2019: Trump Mocks Taylor Swift After Some Spectators Boo Her At Super Bowl\nIt is because to the antitrust officials invariably constrained by the known, it's a fool's errand for VCs to put money behind startups striving to achieve the impossible whereby they topple the existing giants of technology. Missed by the naysayers, however, is that it's the business model of VCs to invest in seemingly \"impossible\" notions. While they'll fail well north of 90 percent of the time, the very few successes will more than pay for all of the failures. Which is the point.\nIt's not just that Amazon and Google are competing with others frequently described as \"Big Tech,\" it's that the valuations of Big Tech are a magnet for a great deal more in the way of investment by intrepid VCs searching for today's startups that will rate the Big Tech descriptor tomorrow. In other words, abundant success that some errantly describe as \"monopoly\" doesn't deter investment, rather it's the biggest driver of it.\nWhich explains once again why Amazon and Google, so prominent in the here and now, are operating as though they're startups. They have no choice. In business, the past and present are lousy indicators of the future.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\n\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The change in the ownership structure has \u201cbeen really a very good move for Kuvimba.\u201d\nPrevious attempts to raise funding were hindered because of speculation over the undisclosed identity of private investors who held about a third of the company. Earlier attempts to hold an initial public offering and form a venture with Russian investors were abandoned.\nKuvimba\u2019s main assets were formerly held by companies tied to Kudakwashe Tagwirei, a politically connected businessman, Bloomberg reported in 2021.\nTagwirei, a one-time adviser to Zimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, has been sanctioned for alleged corruption by the US and the UK. Kuvimba has always denied that he ever held a stake in the company.\nThe government has discussed handing some of Kuvimba\u2019s output to Trafigura Group to repay an outstanding fuel debt, Bloomberg reported in 2022.\nMore than half of the amount the company plans to raise will go toward a building an underground platinum mine at the long-delayed Darwendale project, according to Barnard, who took up his post in December. A lithium project the company estimates will cost as much as $275 million may be quicker to develop, he said.\nThe company has agreed a lithium joint venture with Chinese mining firms, and will finalise the deal by March before proceeding to build the first phase of the project known as Sandawana.\nIt will take about 15 months after signing to start production that will ultimately reach 500 000 tons of lithium concentrate per annum, Barnard said. The Chinese partners will finance the project and transfer it back to Kuvimba once the loan is repaid, a process he estimated would take less than five years.\nKuvimba also plans to develop a second area at Sandawana. Barnard said the company has already received interest from potential investors, including Cluff Africa Ltd. and a major European commodity trader that he declined to name. Other Chinese investors are also keen, he said, adding Kuvimba may sign a deal within six to 12 months.\nCluff didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nAt the Darwendale platinum deposit, the company initially plans to develop a smaller open-pit mine this year that will cost about $50 million to dig. It will pay another mining company to process that ore, according to Barnard.\nKuvimba is in talks with development banks for loans to finance the bigger, underground project and processing facilities, he said, without giving more detail. The targeted start date is within three years.\nZimbabwe holds the world\u2019s second-biggest platinum reserves after South Africa and is Africa\u2019s biggest lithium producer.\nKuvimba is now 70%-owned by the state sovereign wealth fund known as Mutapa Investment Fund, with entities held by the finance ministry, including state pension funds, power utilities and a deposit insurance fund, holding the rest, Barnard said.\nNew Zimbabwe.com\nTweets by NewZimbabweCom\nGet Our Free Newsletter\nAbout NewZimbabwe.com\nNewZimbabwe.com \u2013 The Zimbabwe News You Trust is Zimbabwe\u2019s leading online newspaper and published by New Zimbabwe Media Ltd.\nThe platform brings you the latest breaking News, Business, Showbiz, Sports, Diaspora and gives you everything you\u2019ve come to expect and love.

The Peter Thiel-founded outfit is raising $3 billion, a source told TechCrunch and\u00a0 Axios also reported.\nThe fund, which is intended primarily for additional investments in its successful late-stage portfolio companies, is expected to be significantly oversubscribed.\nFounders Fund\u2019s previous $3.4 billion growth fund closed in early 2022 and is fully invested in companies like Rippling, which raised $200 million in April. Founders Fund is also leading Anduril\u2019s newest raise, on track to be an up to $2.5 billion round at a valuation of $28 billion, CNBC reported. Sources confirmed to TechCrunch that its share will be the largest check Founders Fund has ever written. It\u2019s unclear whether the firm\u2019s reported $1 billion investment in Anduril would be out of that 2022 $3.4 billion fund.\nThe firm will not be raising a ninth core fund for early-stage companies because it was essentially already raised three years ago. Founders Fund reportedly slashed the size of its eighth venture capital fund of about $1.8 billion in half in 2023, Axios reported. The remaining $900 million was pushed into the firm\u2019s core ninth fund.\nThat\u2019s one reason why there\u2019s so much excitement for this new growth fund. While most multi-stage venture firms are raising larger funds, or at least trying to maintain their peak ZIRP-era sizes, Founders Fund is limiting its fund sizes.\nInvestors have reason to want in. Founders Fund has an enviable portfolio of growth companies which not only includes Anduril and SpaceX but Stripe, OpenAI, and Figma.\nFounders Fund declined to comment.\nTopics\nFounders Fund, Fundraising, growth funding, Peter Thiel, Venture\nMarina Temkin\nReporter, Venture\nMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

The pitch: a coveted allocation into an oversubscribed funding round.\n\u201cThe problem that we have is that we have that access, which is a very rare thing, and we\u2019re not able to properly use it,\u201d he says.\nLast year, SPV specialist Sydecar recorded 769 SPV deals for venture-backed startups (not limited to just those led by emerging managers). That\u2019s up from 522 in 2023 and just 274 in 2022. More than 35% of those deals in 2024 were in the seed stage. The top three SPV sectors last year were financial services, enterprise software and healthcare services.\nSimilarly to VC syndicate leads\u2014usually angel investors\u2014emerging GPs often spread their capital across as many deals as possible. The rest of the allocations go to current and prospective LPs.\nThough it includes SPVs used for all purposes, Sydecar notes that the median number of investors per vehicle climbed from eight in 2022 to nine in 2024, and the average from 11 to 16.5. Sydecar SPVs raised a cumulative $476.3 million last year, more than double 2023\u2019s $231.1 million.\nSPVs on the rise\nThough Carta notes a recent dip in deal counts, the company\u2019s data shows the number of annual new SPV deals is up 31% over three years ago, and up 116% from five years ago.\nAccording to the data, SPV median deal size has been on the rise since 2016, when it was $1.18 million in assets. That amount almost doubled to $2.17 million by 2023. The gradual improvement in the market recently has of course played a part.\nEmerging managers have historically been reluctant to charge management fees on SPVs and potentially turn off LPs.\nBut they\u2019ve become much more common, according to Carta: At the height of the venture market in 2021, 41% of SPVs with more than $10 million in assets charged a fee. That rose to 67% by 2023.\nKirsten Morin, HighVista Strategies\u2019 co-head of global venture capital, says fee-charging SPVs for emerging managers are \u201ca way to capture economics\u201d to offset the dearth of fee revenue from small funds.\nCompelling SPV offerings are also a means for emerging managers, who have plenty of competition, to stand out to LPs.\n\u201cIf they have a really strong company, where there\u2019s strong investor demand for exposure...it\u2019s an easy way for a prospective LP to see exactly what they\u2019re buying into,\u201d Morin says. HighVista backs emerging venture managers.\nA \u2018new normal\u2019\nBeyond primary VC deals, SPVs are catching on with emerging managers active in the robust VC secondaries market.\nCaplight found SPVs with multiple buyers or sellers made up 43% of all secondaries tracked by the company in Q4 of 2024. The rest consisted of secondaries in which one buyer purchased shares from one seller, and forward purchase agreements. SPVs were up 10% QoQ, and nearly quadrupled from Q1 2023.\nAvalos, the Caplight CEO, says the increase in these transactions is not \u201can outlier,\u201d but rather \u201cthe new normal\u201d in venture capital. It comes as VC secondaries have taken off, spurring their discounts to narrow.\nHe estimates Caplight data captures up to one-third of all secondaries and is skewed toward US startups. The broader VC secondary boom has been fueled by unicorns flush with cash staying private for unprecedented stretches. The stagnant VC-backed IPO market has not exactly inspired confidence in new listings.\nBoth LPs and GPs expect emerging managers\u2019 use of SPVs in this way to not only continue but to intensify.\n_Featured image by Jenna O\u2019Malley/PitchBook\n_\nLearn more about our editorial standards.\nAbout\u00a0Michael Bodley\nMichael Bodley is a senior venture capital reporter at PitchBook News, covering top fund managers and developments affecting limited partners.

Instead of pursuing additional VC rounds, the company has launched $BEEM, a tech-backed utility token on the Solana blockchain, securing liquidity, long-term financial stability, and an engaged Web3-native community.\nThis move makes Beem the first venture-backed Metaverse company to transition to blockchain-powered funding, signaling a broader shift as deep-tech startups explore alternative funding models beyond the constraints of traditional capital markets.\nThe Shift Away from VC Funding\nOver the past six years, Beem has raised over $6 million from venture capital firms and private investors, developing its patented holographic communication platform. While Big Tech companies like Apple, Meta, and Samsung continue to pour resources into the Metaverse, venture funding in the space has stalled\u2014largely due to the AI investment boom that has shifted investor focus.\n\u201cThe venture finance model has been slow to evolve, while technology continues to accelerate,\u201d said Janosch Amstutz, Beem Founder & CEO. \u201cRight now, investors are all-in on AI, while metaverse companies are overlooked\u2014despite Apple, Meta, and Samsung making clear bets on the space.\u201d\nRather than waiting for institutional capital to re-engage with the sector, Beem has taken a first-mover approach, leveraging the power of blockchain for liquidity and global reach.\nWhy Crypto? Why Now?\nBeem\u2019s decision to launch $BEEM as an alternative to venture capital is not just a funding strategy\u2014it is a deliberate shift toward decentralization and community-driven growth. The crypto model offers advantages that traditional VC funding cannot match, including:\nFast liquidity \u2013 Funding without lengthy VC negotiations or equity dilution\nA tech-native investor base \u2013 Web3-savvy backers who understand decentralized technology\nBuilt-in adoption \u2013 Token holders aren\u2019t just investors; they\u2019re future users of Beem\u2019s communication platform\nUnlike traditional VC models, which often demand significant equity in exchange for funding, crypto-based financing allows Beem to raise capital while retaining full ownership and control of its technology.\nBeem\u2019s Decentralization Roadmap\nBeyond funding, Beem is actively integrating blockchain into its core product, with plans to further decentralize its infrastructure.

All NIH meetings currently are suspended under the new administration.\nBlocking the NIH from conducting the procedural step means payments to researchers still aren\u2019t going out. With a\u00a0yearly budget of nearly $48 billion, the agency is the world\u2019s\u00a0largest public funder\u00a0of biomedical research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really quite nefarious,\u201d Aaron Hoskins, Ph.D., an RNA biochemist and assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Nature. Due to a frozen grant application, Hoskins has had to reconsider hiring graduate students.\nThe legality of the move is under scrutiny because the U.S. Constitution gives Congress\u2014not the president\u2014the ability to dole out funds, David Super, an administrative-law specialist at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., told Nature.\nThe HHS had not responded to Fierce Biotech\u2019s request for comment at the time of publication.\nRelated\nJudge puts nationwide hold on NIH grant change after universities sue\nJudge Angel Kelley for the U.S. District Court in Boston had issued a temporary pause to the federal action across all states after several universities and research centers filed suit Feb. 10.\nThe broad-reaching order followed Kelley\u2019s temporary restraining order against the action in 22 states that have also sued.\nBoth lawsuits have hearings slated for today, Feb. 21.\nNIH academic research grants Donald Trump National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Biotech Research\nConnect\nThe Team\nAdvertise\nMarketing Kit\nLet's Talk\nJoin Us\nNewsletters\nResources\nRSS Feeds\nOur Brands\nFierce Pharma\nFierce Biotech\nFierce Healthcare\nOur Events\nLife Sciences Events\n\u00a92025 Questex LLC All rights reserved.\nTerms of use\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Settings", "title": "Procedural \u2018loophole\u2019 leaves NIH grants frozen, despite orders from federal judge: reports - Fierce Biotech", "score": 0.304828, "published_date": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:03:51 GMT", "content": "NIH funding still frozen, despite judge\u2019s orders: reports Fierce Events Fierce Events Procedural \u2018loophole\u2019 leaves NIH grants frozen, despite orders from federal judge: reports The Trump administration is exploiting an administrative loophole to keep national research funding frozen, despite a federal judge ordering for a halt to the action, according to Nature.

But he discussed his goal of building a16z into an enduring company, drawing inspiration from JP Morgan and publicly traded private equity firms.\nHistorically, venture capital firms have been partnerships consisting of a \u201csmall tribe of people sitting in a room together, trying to bounce ideas off of each other when they make investments,\u201d Andreessen said on the podcast.\nThe problem with the partnership model, he said, is that it\u2019s highly dependent on the ideas and expertise of those people at the table with \u201cno underlying asset value,\u201d as he described it. Once the original partners retire, the firm loses a lot of its value, even if a new generation of investors takes over.\n\u201cBut even if they can keep it going, there\u2019s no underlying asset value. That next generation is just going to have to hand it off to the third generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably going to fail on the third generation. It\u2019s going to be on Wikipedia someday: that firm existed, and then it went away.\u201d\nThe partnership model can be lucrative. A16z\u2019s billions under management generates sizable money management fees for the firm, in addition to profits made when its investments succeed.\nHowever, Andreessen said he constantly reminds internal staff and limited partners that the company isn\u2019t raising money just to harvest the fees. It\u2019s to give the company the cash to invest in growing companies.\n\u201cWhen we go for scale, it\u2019s because we think it\u2019s necessary to support the kinds of companies we want to help our founders build,\u201d he said.\nAndreessen says his bigger goal for a16z is to create a company that lasts. An alternative to a partnership is to build an investment company that\u2019s managed like a business, which means it has management, multiple layers of staff, division of labor with specializations, and training programs, Andreessen said.\nThere are certainly precedents of small partnerships evolving into large corporations, which Andreessen can use as a model for a16z\u2019s ambitions.\n\u201cGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan, 100 years ago, looked like little venture capital firms,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThen their leaders, over time, turned them into huge franchises and big public companies.\u201d\nHe named other examples, too, of private partnerships turned into large publicly traded companies like big private equity firms. Blackstone, which now has a market capitalization of over $200 billion, went public in 2007. Apollo, KKR, and Carlyle held their IPOs soon after Blackstone, and TPG listed on Nasdaq in early 2022.\nAndreessen argues that as these companies grew from partnerships into large corporations, their long-term success became less dependent on a few key investors.\n\u201cA big part of what we\u2019ve been trying to do is build something that has that kind of enduring aspect to it,\u201d he said.\nIn many ways, Andreessen Horowitz already looks more like an operating company than many VC firms. A16z has dozens of people in its marketing group and large teams that help portfolio companies recruit talent and sell their products. The firm runs separate crypto, bio and health, and American dynamism strategies.\nBut maybe there\u2019s another reason Andreessen is keen to restructure away from the classic VC system. When it comes to partnerships, he says, \u201cIt actually turns out in most cases, what you discover is that people actually don\u2019t like each other that much.\u201d\nTopics\na16z, Asset Management, Goldman Sachs, jp morgan, Marc Andreessen, Venture\nMarina Temkin\nReporter, Venture\nMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

As a result, Brown-Philpot said it took about two years for the firm to close Fund I, she told the outlet. Fund I seeks to focus on companies at the Series A and B stages, with Brown-Philpot noting in her announcement blog post that there are few firms focused on leading later-staged investments for diverse founders.\nCherryrock did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\nThe fund\u2019s thesis comes during a time when diversity initiatives, programs, and focuses are under political and legal fire.\nSo far, Cherryrock has already backed two companies: co-leading the Series B of the AI company Coactive AI alongside Emerson Collective. Other investors included a16z and Bessemer. Cherryrock also invested in the Series A round for the YC health company Vitable, alongside Citi Impact Fund and First Round Capital.\nBrown-Philpot is extremely accomplished. She previously worked at Alphabet and Google and serves on the board of various companies including StockX and HP. She was also a founding member of the Opportunity Fund, which is Softbank\u2019s $100 million vehicle for backing diverse founders.\nTopics\nDEI, fundraising, Venture, venture\nDominic-Madori Davis\nSenior Reporter, Venture\nDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

When Afore raised its third $150 million fund in 2022, the firm wrote checks ranging from $1 million to $2 million, which the general partners Anamitra Banerji and Gaurav Jain argued helped companies grow faster.\nThe firm\u2019s strategy worked. Today, its 200-company portfolio has a collective valuation of over $13.5 billion, and over the last year, Afore has returned $47 million (one times its first fund) to its limited partners, Afore claims. Since the firm was founded in 2017, Afore has invested in startups like Modern Health, BenchSci, Neo Financial, New Lantern and Hightouch, which closed an $80 million round at a $1.2 billion valuation this week.\nDespite Afore\u2019s early success, Banjeri and Guarav say that not all young startups need as much capital as the firm has been offering. On Thursday, Afore is unveiling its fourth $185 million fund and a new strategy, which the firm is calling pre-seed 2.0. The partners describe the refined investment approach with one word: flexibility.\n\u201cWe can write a small check, we can write a bigger check, but the idea is, we want to help you get the business off the ground,\u201d Banjeri said.\nFor the founders who already know what they want to build, the firm will still consider investments up to $2 million. However, Afore also wants to take a bet on aspiring entrepreneurs who have yet to come up with a concrete startup idea. Those people may not need as much funding because, in many cases, they have yet to leave their jobs or are still university students.\nImage Credits:Afore Capital\nAfore has launched an 8-week Founders-in-Residence (FIR) program for the founders still in their ideation stage. The firm claims that FIR is very different from an accelerator like YC. Each cohort consists of only five to eight founders who are given an opportunity to explore startup ideas. \u201cThe goal is to invent. The goal is to build. The goal is not to fundraise,\u201d Jain said.\nUnlike YC, which offers standard terms to each company, Afore tries to customize each investment for its FIR founders depending on the startup\u2019s needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the polar opposite of an accelerator. Or we\u2019re not trying to accelerate anything. We are trying to invent a product alongside our founders,\u201d Banjeri said, adding that the firm wants to give startups a chance to pivot or iterate without time pressure.\nFrom its fourth fund, Afore will invest in approximately 35 to 40 pre-seed companies and 50 to 75 founders that go through its FIR program.\nTopics\nAfore Capital, Fundraising, pre-seed, Venture\nMarina Temkin\nReporter, Venture\nMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.
